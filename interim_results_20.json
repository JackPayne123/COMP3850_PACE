As Real Madrid prepare for their La Liga clash against Granada at the Bernabeu on Sunday, Benzema shared a video of him singing along to Tupac's classic track 'Check Out Time'. Tupac's track 'All Eyez on me' might have been a more suitable choice for the Los Blancos star, however, as Benzema looks to add to his goal tally of 20 goals in all competitions so far this season. Real Madrid and France forward Karim Benzema sings along to Tupac in his\u00a0Bugatti Veyron . Benzema boldly stated earlier this week that he can win the Ballon d'Or award during his career. The France international is confident his club success at the Bernabeu can force his way into contention for the prestigious award. However, Benzema's Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has picked up the last two accolades for the world's best footballer whereas Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi prevailed between 2009-12. Benzema vents his frustration during France's recent 3-1 loss to Brazil at the Stade de France in Paris . Despite the duo's dominance, Benzema is adamant he can compete for the title if he continues to perform for Real Madrid and at international level. 'If I keep winning titles then I can win this award in future,' he told Le Parisien. 'We have Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, the two best players. We know I won't reach 80 or 100 goals in a season. They can do that.' Benzema (right) has scored 20 goals, in all competitions, for Real Madrid this season .",

The image, which is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group called 'The Disciples of the New Dawn' in the U.S, has been circulating on mother's groups in Australia. University of Sydney's Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz told Daily Mail Australia the image represents a broader anti-caesarean sentiment which has harmful consequences for women who should be choosing caesareans for health reasons. An offensive image circulating social media which endeavours to shame women who have undergone caesareans . \u2018They are suggesting that it's the woman's own fault if she need a caesarean. That\u2019s like saying it\u2019s your fault that have an inflamed appendix, or bowel cancer. It\u2019s plain stupid.\u2019 The world-renowned gynaecologist says a drive to reduce the rates of C-sections is forcing obstetricians to 'act against their own better professional judgment.' \u2018While it sits on the the extreme end of the caesarean spectrum, it\u2019s an attitude which is actually widespread in Australia. That\u2019s why I feel it needs to be addressed.\u2019 Professor Dietz said the sharp rise in Caesareans since the 1980\u2019s has triggered a strong movement from people trying to curb the rates. Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births . Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz said the image represents an attitude which is widespread in Australia . \u2018The reality is that your average newborn is much bigger now than in the past, and for some women Caesareans are the safest option. It\u2019s downright dangerous to deny women that right.\u2019 Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births.

    "text": "An offensive image circulating on social media, originating from an American religious group, is being condemned by doctors for shaming mothers who have had caesarean sections. The image implies that women who have C-sections are \"too lazy\" to give birth naturally.  \n\nDoctors, like Professor Hans Peter Dietz, argue this reflects a harmful anti-caesarean sentiment that ignores legitimate medical reasons for the procedure. While the World Health Organization aims to reduce C-section rates to 10-15%, experts warn that denying women this option when medically necessary is dangerous. The campaign is seen as an attempt to pressure mothers into adhering to the WHO's recommendation, disregarding individual circumstances and medical advice.",

The striker has scored 31 times for MK Dons and Wolves - just one ahead of Tottenham hotshot Kane. Afobe bagged 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before January - including two in their 4-0 League Cup win over Manchester United - and has added 12 more since joining Wolves from Arsenal on a permanent deal. Benik Afobe says he feels 'unstoppable' at the moment as he aims to become the country's top scorer . The Molineux hitman is expected to make his 50th appearance of the season at Wigan on Saturday and after his breakthrough campaign Afobe's confidence is sky high. 'I had self belief but when you play week in, week out you're going to get more confidence - it's a different type of confidence - it's one to know you're unstoppable,' he told Press Association Sport. 'At the moment we do analysis on the other team, the defenders, the keeper, and you hear this player was playing in the Premier League and has experience but I don't care at all, not one bit. 'It doesn't matter what league I'm playing in I'm going to score. 'It's the mentality you've got to change to be a top goalscorer and I've realised that.

'All the top goalscorers who score week in, week out like (Lionel) Messi and (Sergio) Aguero, they believe they are going to score before they've had a chance and that's the only difference between a top goalscorer and an average striker.' Wolves have two games left in the Sky Bet Championship and are three points outside the play-offs after Afobe's goal rescued a 1-1 draw with Ipswich on Saturday. Kane has five matches left in the Barclays Premier League with Spurs but Afobe is focused on scoring himself and is not jealous of Kane's success after he dropped out of the top flight for regular football. Harry Kane has been in red hot form this season and scored the third away to Newcastle on Sunday . 'He has five games and I have two,' said the confident but grounded 22-year-old. 'I have played with a lot of these players Harry, Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere who's my friend, but everyone has their own destiny. 'I have never looked at one player and thought 'that could have been me'. I think that's another reason why I'm doing well. 'I never compare myself to any player. The way people don't succeed in life is that they worry about other people too much. 'I wanted 30 goals. I got to 30 and now I want to keep scoring, I want to get to 35. People have asked 'what's my favourite goal?' I always say 'the next one'.' Afobe scored a double against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup while on loan at MK Dons .",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nFloyd Mayweather's spending habits are well known but his car dealer has revealed that the boxer bizarrely rang him at 3am to order a Bugatti - insisting the car was to be in his driveway in just 12 hours. The \u00a31.5million valued super-car was delivered just 11 hours later, and was added to his collection of impressive motors. Obi Okeke, who owns Fusion Luxury Motors, was interviewed on the video on Mayweather's Facebook page and spoke about the very late phone call he received. Floyd Mayweather rang his car dealer at 3am to order a \u00a31.5million Bugatti to be delivered in 12 hours . Obi Okele, the owner of Fusion Luxury Motors, was given the task of getting Mayweather the Bugatti . He said: 'The most challenging thing I've ever done for Floyd is when he called me at three o'clock in the morning and said, Obi, I want a Bugatti and I want one in my driveway in 12 hours. 'I then showered, went into my office, did some work and hopped on a plane and got the car, in his driveway, in 11 hours and that makes me a better person, it makes me work harder, it makes me not limit myself, so those are the things that rub off on me from him.' It's not the only request that Okele has had to deal with from Mayweather's extravagant demands, as the fighter once turned up at the dealership at 2am - walking out with a Ferrari Enzo. 'I got a call from overseas in the Middle East that there was a US-spec Enzo for sale, so I hopped on a plane and flew to Abu Dhabi. I then transacted the car and put it in a Boeing 777 passenger plane and flew it out of Abu Dhabi. 'So Floyd came to the dealership and he kept coming and looking at the car. Then he came in one night around two in the morning and said, \"Obi, I wanna buy two Ferrari 458s,\" and that's what he said. 'Then I said OK, then he pauses for a minute and goes, \"Obi, I'm not going to buy them 458s, I want to buy that Enzo and I want to buy it now. Lets go.\"' Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao is just three weeks away and the undefeated champion continues to work in the gym and keep his impressive record intact. This Bugatti is similar to the one Mayweather purchased at 3am and is worth an estimated \u00a31.5million . The interior of the super-car is in pristine condition and is one of a number of Bugatti's Mayweather owns .",

Okeke recounted his experiences in an interview on Mayweather's Facebook page, noting how these challenges motivate him to work harder. These stories came as Mayweather was preparing for his mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao, while continuing to add to his collection of luxury cars.",

They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there\u2019s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we\u2019d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I\u2019ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we\u2019re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for \u00a3295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work \u2014 we spent nearly \u00a3200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone \u00a3250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn\u2019t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost \u00a3400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country \u2014 the most we\u2019ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year\u2019s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for \u00a3200. They said: 'We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around \u00a345,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It\u2019s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we\u2019re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: \u2018Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?\u2019 We\u2019re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost \u00a3200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I\u2019ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s \u2014 they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there\u2019s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we\u2019ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn\u2019t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it\u2019s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it\u2019s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about \u00a310,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I\u2019ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for \u00a3100 each. But it\u2019s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for \u00a340 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves \u2014 they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can\u2019t help but buy it \u2014 at one point I owned six. I\u2019ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it\u2019s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn\u2019t want my house to look like everyone else\u2019s \u2014 that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum\u2019s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick \u2014 Andy Warhol\u2019s muse \u2014 I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about \u00a320 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at \u00a3100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost \u00a35 from a charity shop \u2014 I don\u2019t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don\u2019t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I\u2019ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn\u2019t fit in my kitchen so I\u2019ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that\u2019s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits. Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nAs a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes, and 27 per cent of these say it is the side-effect that troubles them the most. This rings true for Craig. 'People don't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning,' he says. 'I am basically a menopausal man. I have mood swings and I've put on two-and-a-half stone. But the worst thing has been the hot sweats. I'm up a few times a night, sometimes having to change the sheets and it's tiring. 'Of course, this wakes Sue up, too, and then she's worrying. 'She used to have hot flushes and so she's very sympathetic. The difference with me is that I don't know if they will ever end.' Men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life, says Ali Rooke. 'But men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated.' She says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side-effects of hormone therapy. 'Men are warned about side-effects, but clinic appointment times are not long, so doctors can't realistically talk through them all in detail. It's also hard to predict what side-effects a man will have and how he will respond.' There are treatments to alleviate hot flushes, such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone, which has an effect like testosterone but doesn't fuel the growth of cancer cells. Some men find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, or herbal supplements, such as sage tea or black cohosh, help, but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically. But now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, a psychological technique and talking therapy, could help. This causes hot flushes and night sweats . A trial on prostate cancer patients at King's College London, published in March, has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally. CBT works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs, thoughts and behaviour. It's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions. Myra Hunter, professor of clinical health psychology at King's, has previously found that CBT reduces hot flushes in menopausal women, and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen. 'Beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms,' she says. Professor Hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful, positive ones, they will have less of an impact. Her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week. Half the group were given treatment as usual (access to doctors and information about the problem) and the other half received a self-help CBT booklet, a CD and two sessions with a psychologist. The men were taught breathing exercises, advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management, and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions. 'Women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status,' says Professor Hunter. 'In our interviews with men, we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity. 'They felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them. And they catastrophised, so if they had one in the night they assumed they'd feel terrible the next day.' After six weeks, the CBT group's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent, compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group. CBT is not always easily available on the NHS. Professor Hunter is hoping to offer her self-help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through Prostate Cancer UK, but this has not yet been confirmed. Craig was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago, at the age of 50, so quality of life is important to him. By the time of his diagnosis, the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, so surgery was not an option. While the hormone treatment has been helpful, the hot flushes have been hard to deal with. He is about to try a new type of radiotherapy, but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely. However, he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely. 'From the beginning I've been open about my condition, so all my friends and clients know why I have hot flushes. 'It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My family and I have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we've got.' prostatecanceruk.org .",
    "text": "Craig Lister, a 54-year-old wealth management consultant from Watford, is undergoing hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer, leading to frequent hot flushes as a side effect. Diagnosed in 2012, Craig's treatment lowers testosterone to control cancer growth, but causes significant side effects like hot flushes, mood swings, weight gain, and fatigue, akin to menopause symptoms. While hormone therapy can't cure the cancer, it helps manage it and is essential for men with advanced or spreading prostate cancer. Many men, including Craig, experience severe hot flushes, which can be distressing and disruptive. To mitigate these effects, some patients turn to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as recent studies show it can significantly reduce the frequency and impact of hot flushes. Despite the challenges, Craig maintains a positive outlook, openly discussing his condition with friends and clients and focusing on gratitude and living in the present.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\n8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is \u2018shameful\u2019 to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. \u2018People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.\u2019 Ending screening at 73 \u2018doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that ageing is changing\u2019, adds Nat Lievesley. \u2018It\u2019s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.\u2019 Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

    "text": "Summary:\n\nThe article discusses the debate surrounding breast cancer screening age limits in the UK. Key points include:\n\n1. Currently, women aged 50-70 are invited for mammograms every three years.\n\n2. MPs are calling for the upper age limit to be extended, as 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed with breast cancer annually.\n\n3. The age limit is set to increase to 73 by the end of 2016, but critics argue this is not high enough.\n\n4. Older women are less likely to receive certain treatments for breast cancer compared to younger patients.\n\n5. There are concerns about potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment if screening is extended to all older women.\n\n6. Women can request mammograms at any age, but many are unaware of this option once invitations stop.\n\n7. Some experts suggest personalizing screening decisions based on individual factors like life expectancy and breast cancer risk.\n\n8. The article highlights the importance of breast awareness and early detection, regardless of age.\n\nThe debate centers on balancing the benefits of early detection with the risks of unnecessary treatment in older women.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA heartbroken father told yesterday how his daughter had been given hard drugs by dealers targeting schools. In an emotional open letter, he told how the \u2018bright and beautiful\u2019 GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine, ecstasy, methadone and \u2018party drug\u2019 meow meow. The father \u2013 identified only as John to protect his family\u2019s privacy \u2013 warned that Class A drugs were widely available to children, and urged schools and police to get tough. He said dealers made the drugs \u2018incredibly cheap and available\u2019 to hook their young customers. A father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground (file pic posed by a model) His daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills, sometimes without knowing what she was taking. She had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know. The father has sent the open letter to his local council, South Gloucestershire, pleading for action to combat a \u2018serious drug problem\u2019. The man described himself as a single parent to a son and daughter \u2013 referred to as Jack and Jill \u2013 who both went to a local secondary. \u2018Two weeks ago I discovered that Jill had been taking Class A drugs for three to four months,\u2019 he said. \u2018How dumb am I not to know? But do you know the signs as a parent?\u2019 The father said he had initially dismissed changes in his daughter\u2019s behaviour as \u2018teenage moodiness\u2019. He has now written an open letter (above) to his local authority, South Gloucestershire, begging them to take the issue more seriously asking if a young person has to die before the problem is addressed . But he told the Bristol Post: \u2018She came to me and said she had got caught up with a group and started taking cocaine and ecstasy. \u2018I had noticed she had been a bit off but I thought it was a teenage daughter rebelling against her dad \u2026 it just didn\u2019t occur to me and I felt na\u00efve and stupid.\u2019 Horrified by his daughter\u2019s revelations, the father said he went to her school and police but officers were \u2018aggressive and threatening\u2019 when his daughter volunteered information, including the names of alleged dealers. He accused authorities of \u2018pretending a problem doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled, adding: \u2018Does a young person here have to die?\u2019 The father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs. The father, only known as John, has called on South Gloucestershire Council to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools . He told how he had limited his daughter\u2019s use of her mobile phone and social media, apparently to stop her falling back into drug use. He said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked. The father said his relationship with his daughter had hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse, saying: \u2018She hates me now.\u2019 But, in the absence of help from authorities, he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to \u2018take control\u2019 to help their children. The despairing father said he could not offer a \u2018simple answer\u2019 but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored. South Gloucestershire council refused to comment and said it was a matter for police. Inspector Adrian Fallows, a neighbourhood police manager for South Gloucestershire, said: \u2018We are working with schools to educate young people about drugs and also to deal firmly with any drugs issues that may arise. \u2018The supply, production and use of drugs in our communities, and the acquisitive crimes associated with drugs, is a serious matter. \u2018We will do whatever we can to protect young people by disrupting the system and bringing to justice anyone dealing drugs and profiting from crime.\u2019",

Speaking to Style.com, Gigi said: 'From Kendall I learned how to deal with the haters. She has a really good sense of when to stand up [on social media] and when to back off.' Scroll down for video . Gigi Hadid has credited her best friend Kendall Jenner, right, for helping her deal with social media haters . And it's not only Kendall, 19, who Gigi has taken social media tips from as she believes former Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss is comfortable with her social media persona. She added: 'I think she does such a good job of showing who she is. She lets her personality really shine in her Instagram.' While Kendall Jenner is taking the fashion world by the storm, she has her fair share of haters. The fledgling model's meteoric rise as a professional runway model reportedly sparked the ire and resentment of some of her colleagues, according to a report. At New York Fashion Week, Kendall was allegedly bullied by her fellow models, who even went so far as to put cigarettes out in her drink. In another incident, Lexi Boling, along with fellow model Binx Walton, left cruel comments on a pre-show image of Kendall shared on Vogue Germany's Instagram feed. The 19-year-old model took inspiration from the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star when it came to learning how to deal with negative feedback . Gigi said that Kendall has a really good sense of when to stand up [on social media] and when to back off . Lexi, 21, tagged her friend Binx, 20, in the comment: '@binxwalton she's never looked better,' with a crying with laughter emoticon. Teen Vogue cover star Binx replied: 'That's f****d up,' with the same animated laughing face. The two comments have since been deleted from the Vogue Germany photo, but followers' horrified responses remain. Lexi has since apologised for the comment. In a statement issued via a representative to E! News, she said: 'I wasn't thinking and made a silly comment. Kendall's had a killer NYFW. A big congrats to her!' Gigi, centre, is best friends with fellow supermodels Cara Delevingne, left, and Kendall, right . The latter remark is certainly true. Kendall is unarguably one of the world's most in-demand stars. Her appearance in a Chanel fashion show in New York City on Tuesday was case in point. Kendall and her best friend Cara Delevingne were linked as they closed the Paris-Salzburg 2014/15 Metiers d'Art Collection at Park Avenue Armory in two very unique and elaborate ensembles - Kendall in black, Cara in white.

That is the verdict of colleague Andrew Thornton when trying to explain what has made AP McCoy such a dominant force in his sport. Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Thornton has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness McCoy's entire career, from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar. AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career . McCoy has two rides at Sandown on Saturday before he retires from professional racing for good . 'It is a bit like watching Lionel Messi on a horse,' said Thornton. 'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill. 'When he was with Martin Pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle\u00a0will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals\u00a0in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.' Richard Hughes, champion Flat jockey, is impressed by McCoy's legendary focus. 'I was on holiday with him in Portugal. AP played two days' golf, flew home to ride at Sedgefield and then back out to play the final day. We told him he was mad.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nEd Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, according to FTSE 100 bosses . Seven out of 10 business chiefs at Britain's biggest companies think Ed Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, a survey has revealed. The poll of FTSE 100 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for David Cameron to remain Prime Minister, despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. It comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a Labour government. It also echoes controversial remarks by the Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina who sparked fury after claiming it would be a 'catastrophe' for the UK if Labour won the election. The poll of 35 business chairman, by the headhunters Korn Ferry, is a further blow to Labour which is struggling to repair its relationship with big business after a series of controversial policy announcements. Mr Miliband last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero-hours contracts and  unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal. He also confirmed plans to raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years to raise cash for a \u00a3400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. One of the FTSE 100 bosses surveyed, who did not want to be named, said businesses could work with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and its economics chief Ed Balls. But he said Mr Miliband's 'tone and rhetoric' had proved 'deeply disturbing', adding: 'At times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business.' Mr Umunna, speaking on Radio 5 Live today, Umunna insisted Labour was no anti-business and defended Mr Miliband's recent announcemtn that Labour would all-but outlaw zero-hours contracts. Mr Umunna admitted not all zero-hours contracts were 'awful and bad', but insisted many workers were being exploited. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband has vowed to force companies to offer staff a full time contract if they have been working regular hours for three months. Mr Umunna said: 'I think this will be massively helpful. There are 1.8million zero hours contracts now and I think this will transform people's lives.' The shadow business secretary has also pointed to Labour's refusal to offer a European referendum as a policy which business supported. David Cameron and George Osborne, out campaigning today, have jumped on business criticism of the Labour Party to boost their core campaign message that only the Tories can be trusted with the economy . He said: 'Business people have been very impressed that Ed took a decision on a matter of principle on the in-out referendum. It would have been easier to dance to Nigel Farage's tune, as the Conservatives have done.' Last week, Mr Umunna and a host of other Labour figures hit out at Britain's top business leaders after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. Mr Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Mr Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Mr Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa and (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher\u00a0has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham\u2019s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327 million in today\u2019s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher\u2019s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford\u2019s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham\u2019s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He\u2019s no longer here to defend himself. It\u2019s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute\u2019s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy\u00a0brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.",
    "text": "A new book by Martin Fletcher, a survivor of the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire, raises suspicions about the fire's origin, suggesting it may have been arson connected to the club chairman's history of business fires and financial troubles. However, the judge who led the original inquiry, which ruled the fire an accident, dismisses the claims as \"nonsense,\" emphasizing the lack of insurance value of the stand and thoroughness of the investigation. While Mr. Fletcher's book doesn't make direct accusations, it highlights a pattern of fires associated with the then-chairman, Stafford Heginbotham, raising questions about potential financial motives. Despite this, authorities maintain the fire was accidental, though they are open to reviewing new evidence. The tragedy, which claimed 56 lives, remains a stark reminder of the importance of stadium safety and continues to resonate deeply within the community.",

Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim . It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD. The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig. Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes, 54, said: 'It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets. Well preserved: It turned out the 'victim' was in fact a stolen, 915-year-old Peruvian mummy . Forensics: Police were called by the cleaners who made the discovery by an archaeological dig site in\u00a0Trujillo . Wrapped up: The mummified remains were discovered in a box, wrapped in rope, by cleaners in Peru . 'But when I opened it I nearly died of heart attack as I saw this grinning skull staring up at me. 'I had no idea it was an ancient mummy, I thought it was someone who had been murdered so I immediately called the police.' A police spokesman said: 'We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton. 'But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site. 'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination. A spokesman there said: 'This is not a Chimu mummy and is most likely pre-Hispanic suggesting it is from another culture pre-dating the Hispanic arrival.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\n(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.",
    "text": "In the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Kathmandu, Nepal, two CNN Heroes, Anuradha Koirala and Pushpa Basnet, are among the survivors facing significant challenges. Koirala, founder of Maiti Nepal, has been accommodating 425 girls at her rehabilitation center, which remains intact but faces water and food shortages. Despite these challenges, she is willing to take in more girls orphaned by the disaster. Her HIV/AIDS hospice and other facilities have suffered damage, leaving many frightened. Basnet, who supports children of incarcerated parents, was forced to evacuate with 45 children to a nearby field after their residence was damaged. Despite limited resources, she remains optimistic. In response to the crisis, several other CNN Heroes have mobilized relief efforts, providing medical aid, emergency shelter, water filters, solar power, and birthing centers to the affected populations.",

Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by. Clearing: Rio's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish, which have been taken to the city's main dump . Olympics: Rodrigo de Freitas lake is set to host the Olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year's Games in\u00a0Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . There is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides. They are being taken to the city's main dump. The die-offs are common in Rio, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage. Rower and Olympic hopeful Felipe Xavier said: 'I have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat.' But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution. In February, twaite shad died  in the blighted waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held. Members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in\u00a0Rodrigo de Freitas lake ahead of the Olympic Games in the city in 2016 . Rubbish collectors will continue to clear the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface in Rio . More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench . The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de\u00a0Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that\u00a0the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature. 'The intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the (sea) water entering the lake, causing a thermal shock,' it said in a statement, reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4C. However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque? Rio de\u00a0Janeiro's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish, which are currently being cleared from the water . Lagoon: There are so many fish on the surface of the lake in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that almost no water can be seen in some places . Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish. Rio's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 Olympics. Authorities have long said  the games would be the catalyst for a major cleanup of the city's waterways, but as the  sporting event approaches with few improvements, they are now admitting that the Olympic promises won't be met.

Rio Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao acknowledged earlier this week 'there's not going to be time' to finish the cleanup ahead of the games, suggesting it might take until the end of 2018 instead.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nDetectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed. The 'crystal clear' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the Metropolitan Police by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene. The worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on Monday last week, believing detectives would already have similar images of the \u00a360m raid. Scroll down for video . Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed . But, even though police raced to obtain the CCTV once the report was made, the force has refused to make the images public \u2013 despite claims it is the best footage yet. It comes after the force was criticised  for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on Good Friday - four days before the raid was discovered. A veteran trader in the London \u00adjewellery quarter told The Sunday Mirror: 'It is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police. The \u00adfootage could be crucial in collaring the crooks. 'You would assume the officers had done everything to get CCTV footage.' Scotland Yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist, with the ex-head of the Flying Squad John O\u2019Connor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as 'totally incompetent'. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company had contacted the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Central Communications Command after the robbers set off the alarm  on Good Friday. But although police recorded the call, it was graded so that \u2018no police response was deemed to be required\u2019. It was not until Tuesday morning that detectives realised what had happened. When asked why the new footage had not been released, a police spokesman said the force would not discuss 'specifics' of CCTV being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal. The 'crystal clear' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain, which was released last week (pictured) Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror - 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard . They said: 'The Metropolitan Police has \u00adobtained and is examining a substantial amount of CCTV footage in relation to the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. 'This footage has come from many different places. We will not discuss the specifics of the CCTV we are examining and will release information in a timely manner for appeal purposes only. 'Police continue to seize CCTV with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses.' Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror, 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard. Mahendra Bavishi, joint director of the safe deposit company, said he was furious at police for ignoring an alarm which went off just on Good Friday . The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted' with the find. One source said the footage 'blows the case wide open'. But detectives later insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Hours earlier, police had refused to tell MailOnline whether they had the footage. The furore raised questions about why the police chose to keep the footage to themselves - or whether they even had the footage - despite it being one of the largest ever burglaries in the capital. But officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad did release images of three suspects. They refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Earlier this week, Mahendra Bavishi, the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the raid, said  he believed it was an inside job. Mr Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives had asked to put some \u2018sensitive\u2019 questions to his British-based son Manish who runs the business - including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. He added that the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. The 69-year-old also told of his fury at police for ignoring the alert from the state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were carrying out the raid. The incident took place over the Easter weekend, when the gang forced their way into 72 safe deposit boxes by sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall. It is estimated that anything from \u00a360million to \u00a3200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company\u2019s vaults in London\u2019s diamond district. Meanwhile, police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden incident and a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than \u00a38.3m, have never been found. It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London, including the use of a heavy-duty drill to bore through concrete walls, and the belief that the well-planned burglary was carried out with the help of an insider. German detectives are now keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in the robbery.",

The heist involved a sophisticated break-in over Easter weekend, with thieves stealing valuables worth an estimated \u00a360 million to \u00a3200 million. Additionally, there are potential links between this heist and a similar burglary in Berlin in 2013, suggesting possible insider knowledge and similar methods used in both crimes.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nHe has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback, but Richard III kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life, a historian has claimed. The last Plantagenet king of England was described by William Shakespeare as a 'poisonous bunch-back'd toad' in his play depicting the monarch. But research on the king's skeleton discovered under a council car park in Leicester revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis. Scroll down for video . Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to a distinctive scoliosisof the spine . Now a new academic paper claims that even this condition, which caused one of his shoulders to be slightly higher than the other, was probably not known about until after his death. Dr Mary Ann Lund, from the University of Leicester's school of English, said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a \u2018hunchback toad\u2019, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king\u2019s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of \u2018scoliosis\u2019, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. She said: 'It is highly likely that Richard took care to control his public image. 'The body of the king was part of the propaganda of power, and even when it was revealed in order to be anointed as part of his coronation ceremony it was simultaneously concealed from the congregation. 'Tailoring probably kept the signs of his scoliosis hidden to spectators outside the royal household of attendants, servants and medical staff who dressed, bathed and tended to the monarch's body.' Writing in the journal Medical Humanities, Dr Lund argues that like other monarchs Richard III's body image would have been carefully controlled. It was only after his death at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 that his physical shape was made public when his corpse was stripped and displayed. Dr Lund said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by Shakespeare. She said were no surviving descriptions of Richard III's distinctive physique from during his lifetime. Instead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the Tudor period. Dr Lund said: 'Stage history has reincarnated Richard as monster, villain and clown, but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body. This reconstruction of Richard III, based on his skull, has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago . Scientists studying the skull of Richard III (above) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died . Scientists used 3D scanning to reconstruct how Richard III's (right) skeleton may have been deformed (left) 'The care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale: traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment, space and assistants. 'Yet, it may have been only a relatively small group of people in Richard's trusted circle who knew of his condition. The absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this, however. 'What is certain is that, after his death, the exposure of Richard's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in Leicester. 'That moment after Bosworth inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process, in which an ever-more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye, his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him. The skeleton of Richard III, with the curve in his spine clearly visible, was found under a car park in Leicester . 'When Shakespeare's Richard boasts of his shape-changing potential, he registers too the bending course of history and myth making.' Analysis of Richard III's skeleton, which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of Grey Friars Abbey in Leicester in 2012, showed that many depictions of the king's appearance had been exaggerated. A 3D reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right. The condition would have developed in his early teens, but was far from being a hunchback. The scientists at the University of Leicester who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp. However, there are some that point to the alleged murder of Richard III's nephews Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury - the so called Princes in the Tower - as evidence of the king's character. They say this act of infanticide is what earned the Plantagenet king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king\u00a0was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.",
    "text": "Despite his portrayal by Shakespeare as a deformed and villainous hunchback, Richard III's scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) was likely a well-kept secret during his lifetime. Dr. Mary Ann Lund argues that tailoring and armor would have disguised his condition, which, while noticeable, wouldn't have caused a hunchback or limp.  \n\nDr. Lund believes Richard III carefully managed his public image, and it was only after his death at the Battle of Bosworth that his body was displayed and his scoliosis became public knowledge. This, she posits, led to the exaggerated accounts of his deformity, later perpetuated by Shakespeare. \n\nWhile Richard III's skeleton does show evidence of scoliosis, 3D reconstructions suggest it was less severe than historically depicted. Although some argue his alleged role in the \"Princes in the Tower\" case cements his villainous reputation, Dr. Lund's research challenges the traditional, physically defined image of Richard III, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of the king and his legacy.",
