The \u00a31.5million valued super-car was delivered just 11 hours later, and was added to his collection of impressive motors.

They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there\u2019s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we\u2019d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I\u2019ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we\u2019re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for \u00a3295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work \u2014 we spent nearly \u00a3200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone \u00a3250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn\u2019t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost \u00a3400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country \u2014 the most we\u2019ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year\u2019s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for \u00a3200. They said: 'We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around \u00a345,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It\u2019s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we\u2019re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: \u2018Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?\u2019 We\u2019re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost \u00a3200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I\u2019ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s \u2014 they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there\u2019s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we\u2019ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn\u2019t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it\u2019s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it\u2019s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about \u00a310,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I\u2019ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for \u00a3100 each. But it\u2019s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for \u00a340 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves \u2014 they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can\u2019t help but buy it \u2014 at one point I owned six. I\u2019ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it\u2019s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn\u2019t want my house to look like everyone else\u2019s \u2014 that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum\u2019s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick \u2014 Andy Warhol\u2019s muse \u2014 I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about \u00a320 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at \u00a3100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost \u00a35 from a charity shop \u2014 I don\u2019t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don\u2019t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I\u2019ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn\u2019t fit in my kitchen so I\u2019ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that\u2019s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nAs a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes, and 27 per cent of these say it is the side-effect that troubles them the most. This rings true for Craig. 'People don't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning,' he says. 'I am basically a menopausal man. I have mood swings and I've put on two-and-a-half stone. But the worst thing has been the hot sweats. I'm up a few times a night, sometimes having to change the sheets and it's tiring. 'Of course, this wakes Sue up, too, and then she's worrying. 'She used to have hot flushes and so she's very sympathetic. The difference with me is that I don't know if they will ever end.' Men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life, says Ali Rooke. 'But men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated.' She says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side-effects of hormone therapy. 'Men are warned about side-effects, but clinic appointment times are not long, so doctors can't realistically talk through them all in detail. It's also hard to predict what side-effects a man will have and how he will respond.' There are treatments to alleviate hot flushes, such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone, which has an effect like testosterone but doesn't fuel the growth of cancer cells. Some men find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, or herbal supplements, such as sage tea or black cohosh, help, but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically. But now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, a psychological technique and talking therapy, could help. This causes hot flushes and night sweats . A trial on prostate cancer patients at King's College London, published in March, has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally. CBT works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs, thoughts and behaviour. It's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions. Myra Hunter, professor of clinical health psychology at King's, has previously found that CBT reduces hot flushes in menopausal women, and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen. 'Beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms,' she says. Professor Hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful, positive ones, they will have less of an impact. Her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week. Half the group were given treatment as usual (access to doctors and information about the problem) and the other half received a self-help CBT booklet, a CD and two sessions with a psychologist. The men were taught breathing exercises, advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management, and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions. 'Women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status,' says Professor Hunter. 'In our interviews with men, we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity. 'They felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them. And they catastrophised, so if they had one in the night they assumed they'd feel terrible the next day.' After six weeks, the CBT group's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent, compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group. CBT is not always easily available on the NHS. Professor Hunter is hoping to offer her self-help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through Prostate Cancer UK, but this has not yet been confirmed. Craig was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago, at the age of 50, so quality of life is important to him. By the time of his diagnosis, the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, so surgery was not an option. While the hormone treatment has been helpful, the hot flushes have been hard to deal with. He is about to try a new type of radiotherapy, but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely. However, he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely. 'From the beginning I've been open about my condition, so all my friends and clients know why I have hot flushes. 'It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My family and I have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we've got.' prostatecanceruk.org .",
    "text": "Craig Lister, a 54-year-old wealth management consultant from Watford, is undergoing hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer, leading to frequent hot flushes as a side effect. Diagnosed in 2012, Craig's treatment lowers testosterone to control cancer growth, but causes significant side effects like hot flushes, mood swings, weight gain, and fatigue, akin to menopause symptoms. While hormone therapy can't cure the cancer, it helps manage it and is essential for men with advanced or spreading prostate cancer. Many men, including Craig, experience severe hot flushes, which can be distressing and disruptive. To mitigate these effects, some patients turn to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as recent studies show it can significantly reduce the frequency and impact of hot flushes. Despite the challenges, Craig maintains a positive outlook, openly discussing his condition with friends and clients and focusing on gratitude and living in the present.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\n8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is \u2018shameful\u2019 to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. \u2018People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.\u2019 Ending screening at 73 \u2018doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that ageing is changing\u2019, adds Nat Lievesley. \u2018It\u2019s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.\u2019 Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

In an emotional open letter, he told how the \u2018bright and beautiful\u2019 GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine, ecstasy, methadone and \u2018party drug\u2019 meow meow. The father \u2013 identified only as John to protect his family\u2019s privacy \u2013 warned that Class A drugs were widely available to children, and urged schools and police to get tough. He said dealers made the drugs \u2018incredibly cheap and available\u2019 to hook their young customers. A father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground (file pic posed by a model) His daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills, sometimes without knowing what she was taking. She had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know.

He accused authorities of \u2018pretending a problem doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled, adding: \u2018Does a young person here have to die?\u2019 The father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs. The father, only known as John, has called on South Gloucestershire Council to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools . He told how he had limited his daughter\u2019s use of her mobile phone and social media, apparently to stop her falling back into drug use. He said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked. The father said his relationship with his daughter had hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse, saying: \u2018She hates me now.\u2019 But, in the absence of help from authorities, he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to \u2018take control\u2019 to help their children. The despairing father said he could not offer a \u2018simple answer\u2019 but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored.

'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill. 'When he was with Martin Pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle\u00a0will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals\u00a0in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.' Richard Hughes, champion Flat jockey, is impressed by McCoy's legendary focus. 'I was on holiday with him in Portugal. AP played two days' golf, flew home to ride at Sedgefield and then back out to play the final day. We told him he was mad.'",

Seven out of 10 business chiefs at Britain's biggest companies think Ed Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, a survey has revealed. The poll of FTSE 100 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for David Cameron to remain Prime Minister, despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. It comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a Labour government. It also echoes controversial remarks by the Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina who sparked fury after claiming it would be a 'catastrophe' for the UK if Labour won the election. The poll of 35 business chairman, by the headhunters Korn Ferry, is a further blow to Labour which is struggling to repair its relationship with big business after a series of controversial policy announcements. Mr Miliband last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero-hours contracts and  unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal. He also confirmed plans to raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years to raise cash for a \u00a3400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. One of the FTSE 100 bosses surveyed, who did not want to be named, said businesses could work with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and its economics chief Ed Balls. But he said Mr Miliband's 'tone and rhetoric' had proved 'deeply disturbing', adding: 'At times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business.' Mr Umunna, speaking on Radio 5 Live today, Umunna insisted Labour was no anti-business and defended Mr Miliband's recent announcemtn that Labour would all-but outlaw zero-hours contracts. Mr Umunna admitted not all zero-hours contracts were 'awful and bad', but insisted many workers were being exploited. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband has vowed to force companies to offer staff a full time contract if they have been working regular hours for three months. Mr Umunna said: 'I think this will be massively helpful. There are 1.8million zero hours contracts now and I think this will transform people's lives.' The shadow business secretary has also pointed to Labour's refusal to offer a European referendum as a policy which business supported. David Cameron and George Osborne, out campaigning today, have jumped on business criticism of the Labour Party to boost their core campaign message that only the Tories can be trusted with the economy . He said: 'Business people have been very impressed that Ed took a decision on a matter of principle on the in-out referendum. It would have been easier to dance to Nigel Farage's tune, as the Conservatives have done.' Last week, Mr Umunna and a host of other Labour figures hit out at Britain's top business leaders after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. Mr Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Mr Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Mr Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa and (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.'",

A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher\u00a0has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham\u2019s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327 million in today\u2019s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher\u2019s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford\u2019s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham\u2019s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He\u2019s no longer here to defend himself. It\u2019s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute\u2019s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy\u00a0brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.",

While Mr. Fletcher's book doesn't make direct accusations, it highlights a pattern of fires associated with the then-chairman, Stafford Heginbotham, raising questions about potential financial motives. Despite this, authorities maintain the fire was accidental, though they are open to reviewing new evidence.

Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.",

Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed . But, even though police raced to obtain the CCTV once the report was made, the force has refused to make the images public \u2013 despite claims it is the best footage yet. It comes after the force was criticised  for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on Good Friday - four days before the raid was discovered. A veteran trader in the London \u00adjewellery quarter told The Sunday Mirror: 'It is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police. The \u00adfootage could be crucial in collaring the crooks. 'You would assume the officers had done everything to get CCTV footage.' Scotland Yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist, with the ex-head of the Flying Squad John O\u2019Connor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as 'totally incompetent'. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company had contacted the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Central Communications Command after the robbers set off the alarm  on Good Friday. But although police recorded the call, it was graded so that \u2018no police response was deemed to be required\u2019. It was not until Tuesday morning that detectives realised what had happened. When asked why the new footage had not been released, a police spokesman said the force would not discuss 'specifics' of CCTV being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal. The 'crystal clear' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain, which was released last week (pictured) Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror - 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard . They said: 'The Metropolitan Police has \u00adobtained and is examining a substantial amount of CCTV footage in relation to the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. 'This footage has come from many different places. We will not discuss the specifics of the CCTV we are examining and will release information in a timely manner for appeal purposes only. 'Police continue to seize CCTV with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses.' Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror, 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard. Mahendra Bavishi, joint director of the safe deposit company, said he was furious at police for ignoring an alarm which went off just on Good Friday . The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted' with the find. One source said the footage 'blows the case wide open'. But detectives later insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Hours earlier, police had refused to tell MailOnline whether they had the footage. The furore raised questions about why the police chose to keep the footage to themselves - or whether they even had the footage - despite it being one of the largest ever burglaries in the capital. But officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad did release images of three suspects. They refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Earlier this week, Mahendra Bavishi, the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the raid, said  he believed it was an inside job. Mr Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives had asked to put some \u2018sensitive\u2019 questions to his British-based son Manish who runs the business - including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. He added that the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. The 69-year-old also told of his fury at police for ignoring the alert from the state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were carrying out the raid. The incident took place over the Easter weekend, when the gang forced their way into 72 safe deposit boxes by sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall. It is estimated that anything from \u00a360million to \u00a3200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company\u2019s vaults in London\u2019s diamond district. Meanwhile, police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden incident and a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than \u00a38.3m, have never been found. It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London, including the use of a heavy-duty drill to bore through concrete walls, and the belief that the well-planned burglary was carried out with the help of an insider. German detectives are now keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in the robbery.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nHe has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback, but Richard III kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life, a historian has claimed. The last Plantagenet king of England was described by William Shakespeare as a 'poisonous bunch-back'd toad' in his play depicting the monarch. But research on the king's skeleton discovered under a council car park in Leicester revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis. Scroll down for video . Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to a distinctive scoliosisof the spine . Now a new academic paper claims that even this condition, which caused one of his shoulders to be slightly higher than the other, was probably not known about until after his death. Dr Mary Ann Lund, from the University of Leicester's school of English, said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a \u2018hunchback toad\u2019, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king\u2019s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of \u2018scoliosis\u2019, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. She said: 'It is highly likely that Richard took care to control his public image. 'The body of the king was part of the propaganda of power, and even when it was revealed in order to be anointed as part of his coronation ceremony it was simultaneously concealed from the congregation. 'Tailoring probably kept the signs of his scoliosis hidden to spectators outside the royal household of attendants, servants and medical staff who dressed, bathed and tended to the monarch's body.' Writing in the journal Medical Humanities, Dr Lund argues that like other monarchs Richard III's body image would have been carefully controlled. It was only after his death at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 that his physical shape was made public when his corpse was stripped and displayed. Dr Lund said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by Shakespeare. She said were no surviving descriptions of Richard III's distinctive physique from during his lifetime. Instead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the Tudor period. Dr Lund said: 'Stage history has reincarnated Richard as monster, villain and clown, but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body. This reconstruction of Richard III, based on his skull, has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago . Scientists studying the skull of Richard III (above) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died . Scientists used 3D scanning to reconstruct how Richard III's (right) skeleton may have been deformed (left) 'The care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale: traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment, space and assistants. 'Yet, it may have been only a relatively small group of people in Richard's trusted circle who knew of his condition. The absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this, however. 'What is certain is that, after his death, the exposure of Richard's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in Leicester. 'That moment after Bosworth inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process, in which an ever-more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye, his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him. The skeleton of Richard III, with the curve in his spine clearly visible, was found under a car park in Leicester . 'When Shakespeare's Richard boasts of his shape-changing potential, he registers too the bending course of history and myth making.' Analysis of Richard III's skeleton, which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of Grey Friars Abbey in Leicester in 2012, showed that many depictions of the king's appearance had been exaggerated. A 3D reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right. The condition would have developed in his early teens, but was far from being a hunchback. The scientists at the University of Leicester who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp. However, there are some that point to the alleged murder of Richard III's nephews Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury - the so called Princes in the Tower - as evidence of the king's character. They say this act of infanticide is what earned the Plantagenet king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king\u00a0was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.",

James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said:\u00a0'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post\u00a0stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled\u00a0Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust.

David Duane Watson, a 46-year-old Tucson firefighter, was arrested without incident Saturday on charges he killed his ex-wife\u00a0Linda Watson, 35, in what detectives say motivated by a custody dispute over their daughter. Police say the dispute continued after Watson's murder as her mother\u00a0Marilyn Cox, 63, tried to obtain visitation rights.

Police said at a press conference on Saturday that Mr. Watson had been the prime suspect in the murders from the start, reports the Arizona Daily Star. Watson has been charged in all three homicides, with police cited DNA evidence. Chief Deputy Chris Nanos said sheriffs never gave up on the cases, writes Tucson News Now. 'It just goes to show you that the men and women of this department are bulldogs,' said Nanos. 'We'll keep tracking you, we'll find you and you will get punished for the crimes you do.' Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson. She was last seen by a friend who'd dropped her off following a church function. Inside the home were found Ms. Watson's pager, Bible and purse. The door to her home was found open and her blood was discovered at the scene. Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson.

Her neighbor, Renee Farnsworth, was also killed in the shooting. Meanwhile. Linda would not officially be declared dead until 2006.

His two, third-place finishes at Sandown Park in front of a packed crowd of 18,000 race fans brought an end to the greatest racing career in history. McCoy, 40, has been champion jump jockey for the past 20 years, and when he was handed the trophy for the final time today by former Arsenal player Ian Wright, it emerged that the Irish jockey will be allowed to keep it in perpetuity. An emotional Tony McCoy takes a moment after he finished third in his 17,630th race at Sandown Park . Some 18,000 people packed Sandown Park to see the 20-time Champion Jockey on his final two rides . McCoy was joined on stage by his wife Chanelle and daughter Eve and young son Archie . McCoy, known to racing fans as AP, was cheered on by his wife Chanelle, and children Archie and Eve. In a career that has lasted more than 25 years, McCoy has ridden in more than 17,000 races and fallen an estimated 1,000 times breaking almost every bone in his body at least once. McCoy looked clearly emotional has he waved to the crowd after finishing third aboard Box Office in his final race. The record-breaking jockey admitted that, unusually, he had difficulty sleeping last night before his final professional rides. McCoy has been Champion Jockey in Britain and Ireland since 1996. During his career he has had 4,348 winners since his first victory in in Thurles, in Tipperary, Ireland on March 26, 1992 aboard Legal Steps. His first British winner was in Exeter in 1994, riding Chickabiddy to victory. AP McCoy was reduced to tears as he competed as a professional jockey for the last-ever time on Saturday . An emotional McCoy couldn't contain his emotions as he waved to the crowd after his last race . McCoy was congratulated by fellow jockeys as he prepared for his final ever race after in Sandown Park . Speaking to Channel 4, McCoy said: 'Today has been way beyond my expectations and thanks to Sandown and all the people who have been here today. It\u2019s been an honour and a privilege. I\u2019ve had a brilliant way of life for the past 25 years. 'I think it\u2019s so much easier to enjoy and be successful in what you do if you like the people you work with and I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky in that respect.' After the race, he was joined on stage by his family where he addressed the crowd. 'I would like to thank the BHA for allowing me to keep the trophy. I have had it a long time. 'I don't think I will ever celebrate retirement. I feel more sadness but I aware it had to happen It felt very different driving in and going into the Weighing Room. 'I went into the sauna for three-quarters of an hour and I will probably never go into one in my life again. 'There has been the last time this and the last time that over the last few weeks but this really is the last time. Last night was probably the first time in my life I didn't sleep well. My routine is going to have to change so much I will have to adapt.' McCoy announced his retirement in February but it was only the passing of the Grand National and his last rides at Cheltenham that made reality hit home. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . McCoy added: 'Race riding has been an addiction. The reason in the last two weeks I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared. 'That is why I announced my retirement when I did. I wanted to prepare myself for not being a jockey. 'I thought that was the best way of coping with it. It has been easy until the last couple of weeks. I am well aware the next two days , two weeks, two months, two years are going to be the most difficult.' 'I have been very lucky and what I would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it. 'In any sport to be successful you have to be prepared to work harder than anyone else. I think I have got talent but I have never thought I am the best at anything. When I look back I don't think I leave much behind.' In his final race, he was beaten by his long-time rival and friend Richard Johnson - who has been runner-up in the Champion Jockey race to McCoy for the past fifteen years. Speaking after the race, McCoy tipped his friend to take over from him next season. 'I\u2019d like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey because he made me achieve a lot of the things that I did. 'I would never have achieved the numbers I have done if it wasn\u2019t for Richard Johnson. That\u2019s no disrespect to Sam Twiston-Davies or Tom Scudamore or Jason Maguire. We have numerous lads who could be Champion Jockey, but personally I would like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey.' In advance of his final rides today, stars from across sport, entertainment and racing paid tribute to McCoy, among them, Arsene Wenger, manager of his beloved Arsenal. The Arsenal boss said: 'I would like to congratulate you AP on your outstanding career. It\u2019s absolutely exceptional what you have done and at Arsenal, who we know you support, we are inspired by that kind of dedication, quality and consistency that you have achieved in your career. Well done.' Presenter Clare Balding said: 'I admire him so much for his skill in the saddle, for his dedication to the sport, for being able to stay at the top of his game for 20 years. 'But I almost admire him more for turning away now, for being able to bow out at the top, I think that takes so much courage. He knows he could carry on for another five years but he doesn\u2019t want to doubt himself. 'He knows that if he doubts himself for a second that will travel down the reigns and the horses won\u2019t believe what he\u2019s always believed, that he is the best.' Sandown Park was packed with fans eager to watch McCoy in his penultimate race on Saturday . The retiring 20-time champion jockey admitted he went into the final two rides of his career with a heavy heart . Retiring jockey McCoy insists he will never return to professional racing after his Sandown farewell . Dame Judi Dench, Actress: 'A winner. He\u2019s a winner. I can\u2019t imagine how he is going to feel, I must say, retiring from having such a kind of glittering career. He was born to ride a horse, he was born to win too. It\u2019s wonderful to meet him and be able to say to him, you\u2019re a legend.' Ian Wright, who presented the Champions Jockey trophy McCoy said: 'AP McCoy is made of something else altogether. For 20 years he has been at the top of his game, riding winners, week in week out. I can think of no other sportsman or woman who can match his record. Like the Arsenal team of 2003/04 he\u2019s proven that he truly is an Invincible. It was an incredible honour to award him with his trophy for the final time on the day he retires.' Trainer Jonjo O\u2019Neill, who : 'He\u2019s a brilliant all-rounder. He was the one man out there you didn\u2019t want riding against you. I was lucky to get a lot of use out of him \u2013 more than anybody else. He\u2019s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the Gold Cup. He gives it the same ride, that\u2019s why he\u2019s very special.' JP McManus, Racehorse Owner and long-standing employer: 'I get enormous pleasure from AP riding. If he is on one of my horses then it\u2019s a bonus but if it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s I still get a thrill out of it. We\u2019ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup. There\u2019s never a right time [to retire], but it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s picking a time of his choosing. He\u2019s an ironman and a lovely man. I\u2019ve grown to love him more and more, as my family have. There\u2019s something deep and great about him.' Tony McCoy signs autographs for punters on his final-ever day as a jockey at Sandown .

Today\u2019s nominee is Petra Wetzel, 40, a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine. She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006... Listening to the Italian businessman on the other end of the line, Petra could see pound signs in front of her eyes. He had heard about the huge popularity of Petra\u2019s bottled beer. Now he wanted to meet to discuss importing it in bulk to Italy. It was a fantastic opportunity. But, as she consulted her diary, Petra \u2014 who runs one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries, knew what her answer had to be. Petra Wetzel, 40 (pictured), is a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine (pictured). She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006 . \u2018He could only offer me a two-hour slot bang in the middle of my son\u2019s sports day last year,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018I had to say No. I\u2019m a businesswoman, but I\u2019m a mum first.\u2019 Blonde, attractive and the founder of one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of \u00a310 million, Petra may well be every man\u2019s dream. But she says with a laugh: \u2018I sound like a real catch. But the truth is I\u2019m fiercely independent, stubborn and work long hours. The only man in my life is Noah. He\u2019s my priority and the reason I drive myself so hard.\u2019 As a single mother, running a hugely successful business is a tall order. What makes Petra\u2019s success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when Noah was just a baby \u2014 and in the wake of a broken marriage. Petra\u2019s flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is stocked in 100 branches of Waitrose in the UK as well as in branches of Tesco in Scotland. And later this year she is opening a second brewery in Glasgow to cope with demand. The germ of the idea came in 1994 when Petra, who was born in Germany, was having a drink with her father, Herbert, in a pub. \u2018I was studying at Glasgow University and Dad had come to visit,\u2019 she recalls. Petra (pictured) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her Glasgow and she realised that the city didn't have its own brewery . He ordered a pint of local lager, took a sip and winced. Then he asked what the best Glasgow lager was and, to my horror, I realised I didn\u2019t know. \u2018In Germany, every village and town has a good brewery. It\u2019s something people are proud of and want to show off to visitors. He couldn\u2019t believe that a city like Glasgow didn\u2019t have its own brewery. It got me thinking.\u2019 Twelve years later, Petra opened a small brewery and beer hall/restaurant with her then husband, Gordon, with the help of a loan from her parents. \u2018I met Gordon at university and married him in December 2000,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018We both had first-class business degrees and, naively, I thought that meant we could easily run a business. I was working as a lawyer, so we agreed Gordon would take charge and I would take a back seat.\u2019 WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Noah was born. \u2018He was conceived on a trip to Chicago, where we\u2019d gone to learn about brewing,\u2019 Petra recalls. \u2018I had been told that I could never have children so, although the timing was terrible because of the new business, we were both ecstatic.\u2019 She adds: \u2018We had bills to pay, so I was working three days a week just two months after Noah arrived. With my legal job and a newborn, I didn\u2019t have time to think about the business. Besides, I thought it was in safe hands.\u2019 The WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Petra's son, Noah was born. She initially started the company with Gordan, her then husband . However, in October 2006, when Noah was just three months old, Petra\u2019s life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart. \u2018I was so devastated, I decided to step away from the business. I focused on looking after Noah and my job.\u2019 However, in December 2007, a little over a year after the break-up of their marriage, Petra had another shock: the business was in crisis. \u2018Gordon was away when the butcher who supplied our restaurant rang and threatened to set fire to my car,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018It turned out the company owed him thousands. \u2018When I went round to the company\u2019s office. I filled a black bin liner with our unpaid invoices, went home and spent the night going over them. We had debts up to our eyeballs.\u2019 Many women would have quit. But looking at her son, Petra realised she didn\u2019t have a choice. \u2018It was sink or swim. Noah gave me the confidence I needed,\u2019 says Petra. \u2018We had ploughed my inheritance into the business. It was all I had. Besides, I knew I\u2019d hit on a great idea. All it needed was graft to make it work. My parents agreed to look after Noah for seven weeks in Germany. The company went into administration. I called in a brilliant firm of accountants and worked flat out on a plan for the future. Petra (pictured with Noah) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles . \u2018It was tough. Noah went into full-time day care and most nights I would still be at my laptop at 1am. Many times, I sobbed myself to sleep. I felt way out of my depth, but I became good at multi-tasking. \u2018I quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it, single-handedly, into the thriving company it is today. We are now a beer brand as well as a restaurant and beer hall. And our flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is sold worldwide. We are just about to send a consignment to Hong Kong. Of course, I have to make tough choices. I could beat myself up about not being there enough for Noah. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times he will be in the car and I have to shush him because I\u2019m taking an important call. \u2018But feeling guilty is just a waste of energy. Noah knows he\u2019s my priority. We are a very tight unit \u2014 particularly as his father now lives in America. We have the most wonderful full-time nanny, Helen, who Noah adores, and I spend every second I\u2019m not working with him. \u2018Recently he said: \u201cMum you are a brilliant Mum and a brilliant Dad.\u201d That meant the world to me. \u2018And thanks to the business, we have a great lifestyle. For my 40th birthday I bought us a treat: a speedboat. It\u2019s moored at Loch Lomond and zipping up and down the water at weekends makes a tough working week worthwhile.\u2019",

They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused:\u00a0Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that\u2019s not where a large portion of the investors\u2019 money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.",

Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, used company credit cards to pay for her \u00a310,000 wedding, as well as a \u00a35,000 honeymoon in the Seychelles. She was arrested at Heathrow when she returned from the honeymoon - but now she has been spared jail even though a court heard that she had been convicted of fraud twice previously. Just married: But Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, pictured during her wedding to David Osborne, stole \u00a317,000 to pay for the ceremony and her luxury honeymoon . Fraud: Saunders, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted cheating her company out of thousands of pounds . Saunders, also known as Gabriella Osborne since getting married at Belair House in Dulwich last September, stole \u00a335,000 from her previous employer PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where she worked as a tax accountant. After serving a jail sentence, she started a \u00a340,000-a-year job as a personal assistant at Insight Investments in June last year. But she proceeded to embezzle a total of \u00a317,000 using her colleagues' credit cards - including \u00a3600 for flowers, \u00a3270 on a new watch, \u00a3210 on a new outfit and \u00a3400 for a mobile phone. The Old Bailey heard Saunders came to the UK from Nigeria and graduated from Southampton University with a law degree in 2004, before starting work at PwC. While working at the multinational firm, Saunders forged taxi receipts to destinations across the country at up to \u00a3250 a time, then signed them off by faking a colleague's signature. Couple: Saunders was convicted of fraud twice before her latest offence . Free: Saunders, pictured with her husband in an engagement photo, was spared jail . Celebration: But Saunders was arrested at Heathrow when the couple returned from their honeymoon . In 2007 she was jailed for six months for fraud, and in 2011 she was again convicted of fraud but spared jail after a court heard she had stolen money from neighbour using credit cards. The day after Saunders started working at Insight Investments in June, she charged \u00a35,272 to a colleague's credit card in order to pay travel agent Trailfinders for her luxury honeymoon with husband David Osborne. Mugshot: Saunders pictured after she was jailed for a \u00a335,000 fraud in 2007 . In September she used another colleague's card to pay \u00a310,254 to Belair House, \u00a3268.20 to the jeweller Andrew Charles, \u00a3597 to PESH flowers, \u00a3208.44 to fashion store ASOS and \u00a3390 to EE T-mobile. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said: 'She paid for a prestige wedding venue, she paid for the flowers, she paid for her honeymoon outfit and clothing. 'She paid for phone calls to make these arrangements and she paid for the gift of a watch. She paid for the honeymoon which was a first-class trip to Dubai and then on to the Seychelles. 'They were arrested at Heathrow when they returned to the UK and she made no comment in interview, but it was clear from the evidence that she was solely responsible for these frauds.' Saunders, from Camberwell in south London, admitted seven counts of fraud totalling \u00a316,990, and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Judge Stephen Gullick decided against jailing her after he was told that she had repaid the money and was retraining as a teacher. He said: 'You have a singularly unimpressive record and you have already served a prison sentence some time ago. Pricey: Saunders spent \u00a310,000 of her firm's money to book Belair House for her wedding reception . Honeymoon: She also stole \u00a35,000 to pay for a luxury post-wedding break in the Seychelles . 'You did not disclose your previous dishonesty to your employers, who were prepared to take you on as an administrative assistant on a good salary. 'The fact is within days you were prepared to take advantage. You effectively defrauded others to the tune of \u00a317,000, all of which has been paid back. That money was used to finance your wedding and the subsequent honeymoon. 'You have now started working in a completely different environment. I hope they will never place you in a position of trust with anything to do with money. 'These were serious offences but it appears you are turning your life around. If you continue to commit offences of dishonest of this nature you will eventually receive a very long sentence of imprisonment indeed.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nSometimes life imitates art, but apparently not when it comes to the Central Intelligence Agency. Current and former female agents spoke out to the New York Times on Sunday to renounce depictions of CIA women on TV shows and in movies. The group of women say they are nothing like the honey-pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown PTSD with booze and pills. Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes, 69, who helped expose her colleague Aldrich Ames as a Russian double agent, says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like State of Affairs and Homeland. 'I wish they wouldn\u2019t use centerfold models in tight clothes. We don\u2019t look that way. And we don\u2019t act that way,' Grimes told the Times. Scroll down for video . That's not me: Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes (pictured above in January 2013) \u00a0is one of many former and current women at the agency speaking out about depictions of female spies on TV and in movies . Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett, one of the 'Band of Sisters' who helped track down Osama bin Laden, has the most trouble with how her fallen co-worker Jennifer Matthews was portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty. In the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, actress Jennifer Ehle plays Matthews as a 'giddy' agent, excitedly baking a Jordanian source a cake for their meeting on his birthday. As in real life, Matthews dies as the agent gets out of his car and detonates a suicide vest. 'The problem is that they portray most women in such a one-dimensional way; whatever the character flaw is, that\u2019s all they are,' Bennett said.\u00a0'It can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function, how we relate to men, how we engage in national security - that is pretty off.' One of the fictional CIA agents currently on screen is Charlie Tucker on NBC's State of Affairs. Played by Katherine Heigl, Charlie is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar, sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist. Another example is Homeland's Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child (the product of a secret relationship with a double agent) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex. A retired covert officer identified as Meredith says sex isn't a major part of the spy game. Offensive: Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett says she was upset with the 'giddy' portrayal of her friend Jennifer Matthews (left) in the movie Zero Dark Thirty (played by Jennifer Ehle, right). Matthews, in real life as in the movie, was killed by a suicide bomber at an Afghanistan military base in 2009 . 'Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. For me, working in the Middle East, there\u2019s a lot of attraction for Middle Eastern men for Western women. I don\u2019t mean necessarily sexually...but curiosity, if nothing else. And we certainly have played that.' However, Meredith says she more often has to put men in their place while doing her work. 'You need to remove [sex] off the table very quickly and clearly. Sometimes it\u2019s \"Get your hands off my knee or I\u2019m going to break it,\" or you put as many people into the room as you can,' she said. While the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated, the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives. It's not about sex: The real women of the CIA say they are not all honey-pots who use their sexuality to control sources (like Carrie Mathison on Showtime's Homeland, played by Claire Danes above) Sending the wrong message: The women also take issue with NBC show State of Affairs, which features Katherine Heigl (above) as a troubled CIA analyst . 'I briefed Condoleezza Rice while in labor. I\u2019d tell her about the global jihad and then I would turn away and breathe. When these two worlds clash, they clash really hard,' Bennett said. Bennett says that the concerns of her job are so important, that it's hard to come home and sympathize with the minor dramas ruling her teenager's life. 'I deal with people who are trying to kill lots of people in horrendous, painful ways. So I have a wall; it\u2019s really tall. Unfortunately, though, what happens with time is you can\u2019t click it on or off. You just block the sensation of feeling,' Bennett said. 'I\u2019m no longer married because of my wall. So I have five kids whose parents aren\u2019t together because I constructed that wall over time and didn\u2019t know how to get through it,' Bennett added. Many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency, which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in Langley and flexible time off. Which is good because Bennett thinks women naturally make great agents. 'Women don\u2019t think more intuitively than men, but we tend to trust our own gut less. We are not going to put all our money in one basket,' she said.",

The play, which stars Glee star Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer, is based on the 2004 film of the same name Weinstein produced starring Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. The couple have been out together numerous times over the past few weeks as well, attending Finding Neverland rehearsals, celebrating Easter together with their children, and at a party for Georgina\u2019s birthday earlier in the week.

The happy couple were joined by stars including Helen Mirren, Bryan Cranston, Ansel Elgort, Darren Criss, Olivia Wilde and Christoph Waltz for the opening night of the play, which received disastrous reviews from critics. New York Magazine called the show 'badly written' and 'frustrating,' while the New York Times\u00a0said the production is 'largely made up of empty calories.' Ambra Battilana (above) claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March . Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.'

According to data, analysed by Harbour Hotels, the average cost of property in London - a whopping \u00a3638,217 - actually falls below that of the Devon enclave. The seaside town in the South Hams district boasts a skyrocketing average property price: \u00a3671,759. According to new data, the average cost of property in Salcombe, Devon, now tops the average cost in London . This is more then the average cost of property in some of the UK's most expensive cities, including Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. And for those who want a room with a water view, that will cost you even more. The average value of a waterfront property in Salcombe tops \u00a32million, putting it ahead of some of London's priciest postcodes, including Notting Hill and Regent's Park. In the west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, prices average \u00a31,629,495, while Regent's Park comes in with an average property value of \u00a31,338,467 and Hampstead Heath close behind at \u00a31,270,274.

In Salcombe, property facing the estuary cost as high as \u00a32 million, with non-sea views tallying \u00a3671,759 . Salcombe made headlines last spring when it was named Britain's most expensive seaside resort. Since then, property prices have continued to soar, increasing ten per cent in the last 12 months alone, which puts Salcombe's property market on par with London's 11 per cent yearly increase. Nearby seaside competitors, like Sandbanks, Aldeburgh and Padstow, however, have seen a dip in prices of about eight per cent on average. Property prices in Salcombe have soared 10 per cent in the last 12 months, while Padstow has seen an 8 per cent decrease . To visit Salcombe - without parting with millions of pounds - the Salcombe Harbour Hotel has rooms from \u00a3425 . With summer quickly approaching, many UK travellers will holiday in Salcombe to soak up a bit of sun and the million pound view. In fact, the most recent assessment places a view of the Salcombe estuary as being worth \u00a31.3 million, given the average property cost of over \u00a3600,000 and an average waterfront property price of \u00a32million. Known as 'Chelsea-on-Sea,' the idyllic waterside community is a yachting and sailing paradise, and home to fresh seafood and many stunning beaches.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nEvidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of Russian bullion, supposedly bound for America, being lost in the river Clyde. The gold and silver bars had been loaded in Murmansk onto a former Irish Sea ferry, converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped to take part in a dangerous Arctic convoy. The bullion was to pay the Americans for arms shipped to Russia during one of the most crucial stages of the Second World War. Scroll down for video . The bullion was loaded onto the HMS Ulster Queen (pictured) in 1942 and was being transferred to the U.S. as payment for weapons when the case of precious metals was lost overboard . The former ferry, HMS Ulster Queen, arrived in Greenock in November 1942, after 13 days at sea and two ships sunk by German U-boats. But as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat, one slipped and fell into the muddy waters. Such a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recovered. In fact, the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the Ulster Queen's engineers, and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Murmansk and Archangel in Russia's extreme northwest. Mr Thomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship RRS Discovery II in the Southern Ocean. He had joined the Discovery as a 17-year-old in his native Portsmouth. He continued his writings on the Convoys - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble, he wrote in code and secreted them well. Before he died in 2000, aged 88, he transcribed some of them into four A4 journals, which his daughter, Leona Thomas, has now edited into a book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Russia's extreme northwest . Leona, 61, a retired school teacher, said yesterday: 'The story about the Russian bullion is fascinating. It must be documented somewhere, but I have never been able to find out what happened afterwards.' According to her father's notes, there had been 'a peculiar silence all through the ship' as she was loaded in Russia. No one was allowed on deck, no one was allowed along the alleyways forward of the engine room, and no one off the mess decks unless they were on watch. Mr Thomas recorded: 'No scuttles [were] allowed to be opened, but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers, up and down the cleared area of the track, hundreds of them, all with rifles and many with Tommy guns. 'Our guards lined the deck, we later heard, either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [mine detectors]. A huge, dark wagon was coaxed, nudged, and jogged until the derrick's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground. 'Officers approached the wagon and examined locks and bolts [with] armed troops literally surrounding it. Then began the laborious manual exercise of [unloading] what looked like ammunition boxes, which required two men to lift. 'Surely this wasn't small arms ammunition! Not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us. It certainly was not. It was bullion! 'Two boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went, deposited on our deck, from where each one was slid and lowered down into the 'B Gun' magazine, never out of sight of at least one officer. 'This was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the USA to arm the Russians.' 'Then into the Wardroom [went the] harassed officials, who, we heard, lashed into the whisky \"as if it were free.\" Probably, with all that off their hands, they could afford to.' Once back in the Clyde, after 'a fast run down the Minches', calamity was to come, however. Mr Thomas wrote: 'It was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the Boom Control vessels, hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture, and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter. 'For the next hour it was cloak-and-dagger stuff again, no one allowed on the upper deck forward of the Wardroom or on the working alleyways. We heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been man-handled onto the upper deck. 'The paravane derrick was reeved [threaded] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch. The first two boxes were slung with a hemp rope-sling. Mr Thomas, who died in 2000 aged 88, pictured with his late wife Louie in 1996 . 'In the shaded lights were many officials, officers, men in good suits, bayonets, torches, clipboards, tarpaulins, surreptitious smokers, but nary an onlooker. 'Our Captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge, his nose barely over the canvas dodger, to observe the last rites of the Russian bullion. 'And then it happened. The first boxes, two in number, were being hauled toward the lighter, and who knows what happened, but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the Clyde. 'I was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a H. M. Bateman cartoon. Needless to say, all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair. 'The rest was capably transferred to a lighter, various bits of paper signed, exchanged, and pocketed, and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clear.' Written in the diaries left for his daughter, Mr Thomas said: 'I was thankful to keep all these years, the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times I found myself in, especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger, both man-made and that of nature.' Leona said of the gold: 'Who knows, it may still be there.' Mr Thomas wrote in his diary how the crew of the Ulster Queen had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for America, so they could 'live it up' for a few days before returning to war-torn Europe. In the end, the decision was apparently made to off-load the cargo in the Clyde, for eventual transfer to another vessel for the Atlantic crossing.

Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option.

He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment .

Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

Once struggling with injuries and form, Fellaini is now seen as a potent attacking threat and has been instrumental in recent victories against Manchester City and Liverpool. Rooney admires Fellaini's ability to relieve pressure by controlling the ball and moving it up the field, describing him as one of the best in the world in that role. Fellaini's improved performances have contributed to United's current six-game winning streak, placing them third in the Premier League.

Sweeten, 19, shot himself in the head while visiting a family member's home in Texas on Thursday morning. His\u00a0manager, Dino May, told Us Weekly there were no signs of trouble prior to him taking his own life in the upstairs part of the house while family members were downstairs. May said: 'Everybody was shocked. 'There was no depression, no nothing. He was a good kid. Teenage stuff, but no depression, no signs or anything.' The young actor, who appeared in 139 episodes of the popular US sitcom, was said by his manager to be anti-drugs, very quiet and very shy. Scroll down for videos . Pictured front left: Sawyer Sweeten stands alongside the Everybody Loves Raymond cast (L-R - Brad Garrett, Monica Horan, Madlyn Sweeten, Sawyer Sweeten, Sullivan Sweeten, Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle) Shock death: Child star, Sawyer Sweeten, seen riding on a motorcycle last month, killed himself while visiting family in Texas yesterday. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head . When news of the suicide broke, actor and comedian, Ray Romano, 57,\u00a0who worked with Sawyer for nine years starting from when he was just a 16-month-old baby, said he was 'terribly saddened, by the news'. He added: 'He was a wonderful and sweet kid to be around. Just a great energy whenever he was there. My heart breaks for him, his family, and his friends during this very difficult time.' Sawyer appeared in 139 episodes of the popular US sitcom and also took small parts in television shows Even Stevens and Frank McKlusky C.I alongside his twin brother Sullivan in the early 2000s. The teenager played Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, while his twin brother played Michael. Their older sister Madylin also played their older sibling on the show, Ally. 'This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred. We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday,' said Madylin in a statement. 'At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love.' Sibling actors: Sawyer Sweeten is pictured, left, in 2010 alongside his sister Madylin and brother Sullivan who also both starred in the show . Grieving sister: Madylin Sweeten took to Facebook yesterday evening to comment on the tragedy . Sawyer's mother Elizabeth posted a photo on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0on Wednesday saying how much she loved her three oldest children. She also shared a post on Facebook last Thursday that showed her and her oldest sons bowling with the family, and one on Easter of the extended family celebrating the holiday. Sawyer's Raymond costar Doris Roberts paid tribute to him on\u00a0Facebook, writing; 'It is with great sadness that I learned the news that Sawyer Sweeten, who played my grandson Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, died at his family's home in Texas. 'He was a very sweet young man who will be dearly missed. Make sure your loved ones know how much you care about them, and please check in with them if you haven't touched base with them for a while. It's very important to keep in touch.' Patricia Heaton, his television mother, wrote; 'Sawyer Sweeten was a funny and exceptionally bright young man. He is gone from us far too soon.' Everybody Loves Raymond ran from 1996 - when the twin boys were just 16 months old - to 2005. The child actor, centre, appeared on stage with the show's cast in 2010 to accept a gong at the 8th Annual TV Land Awards . Devastated family: Sawyer, left, Sullivan and Madilyn with their other sister Maysa (second from right) Television mother:\u00a0Patricia Heaton, who played Sawyer's mother\u00a0Debra Barone on the hit show, wrote this message on Twitter . Based on the stand-up career of lead actor Ray Romano, the show, based on Long Island, was primarily about his strained relationship with his parents and his brother . The children, especially the twins, had smaller, cameo moments and in the beginning were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following in the US, and was shown by Channel 4 in the UK. Sawyer and his brother hadn't acted since the show finished, though their sister did go on to appear in several films, including American Splendor and Eagle Eye. She continues to act and lives in Los Angeles. The three siblings last appeared together in public at the\u00a08th Annual TV Land Awards in 2010. They also have a younger sister Maysa, and four half-siblings; Emma, Guiliana, Elliette and Jaymeson. Madylin wrote on Facebook\u00a0Thursday evening; 'At this time I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to the ones you love. Let them have no doubt of what they mean to you.' In March, Sawyer' mother's husband Jerry posted a photo to\u00a0Facebook of Sawyer on a motorcycle, writing; 'Sawyer is riding around on a really kick ass 883 Iron!!! So proud that both my sons have done so well in learning how to ride!' Sawyer (left) and his brother Sullivan started working on Raymond when they were just 16-months-old . Sawyer was born in Brownwood, Texas in 1995, and also had roles in the film\u00a0Frank McKlusky, C.I. and the popular television show Even Stevens. The cast of Everybody Loves Raymond was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series seven times by the Screen Actors Guild, winning the coveted Actor in 2003. The show meanwhile won the Outstanding Comedy Series award at the Emmys in both 2003 and 2005. Overall, it earned 69 Emmy nominations during its run, winning 15, mostly for acting.

The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop David Cameron up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash \u00a312billion from the benefits bill. In an interview on the BBC, Mr Clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the Tories agreed new taxes on the rich. But the Deputy Prime Minister defended his record in government with Mr Cameron.\u00a0Asked if he was proud of his record in power, Mr Clegg said: 'Hell yes.' Scroll down for video . The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop up David Cameron in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash \u00a312billion from the benefits bill . The Lib Dem leader, meanwhile, accused the Tories of \u2018lashing out\u2019 at Labour because they knew they could not win the election. Mr Clegg's remarks come after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband last week. Mr Fallon said the Labour leader had stabbed his brother in the back to win the leadership and was now 'willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister' by giving up the Trident missile system to secure the support of the SNP. Mr Clegg\u2019s insistence that he will not go into Coalition with the Tories if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the Lib Dems could strike a deal with Labour after the election. However, the Deputy Prime Minister said he would also veto a deal with Mr Miliband if Labour did not set out in more detail how they would slash the deficit. He said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t accept \u00a312billion of welfare cuts. In exactly the same way that I could never countenance recommending to the Liberal Democrats entering into a coalition with the Labour Party that isn\u2019t serious about balancing the books rather than the specious stuff they\u2019ve come up with today. 'Equally I would not recommend to the Lib Dems that we go into coalition with the Conservatives if they insist on a plan which is a marked departure from what we\u2019ve done in this coalition. \u2018They\u2019re asking for \u00a312billion over two years. We\u2019ve made \u00a320billion over five. They want to ask the poorest to make additional sacrifices whilst not asking the richest to pay an additional penny through the tax system to balance the books.\u2019 In\u00a0an interview on the BBC tonight, Mr Clegg said the price of another Coalition would be new taxes on the rich and a scaling back of the Prime Minister\u2019s planned welfare cuts . Asked by host Evan Davis if he felt \u2018betrayed\u2019 by the Prime Minister at any stage since 2010, he pointed to the AV referendum. He said: \u2018It was shoddy it was unnecessary I didn\u2019t think they needed to win the argument by being quite so personal. I wish the referendum had been fought on its merits. \u2018What I have learnt about the Conservatives \u2013 and you can see it in this election campaign \u2013 when they think they\u2019re about to lose their grip on something that they like, usually power, they can lash out, they\u2019re doing it in this election campaign because they realise they\u2019re not going to win it.\u2019 But Mr Clegg said the Coalition had been \u2018worth\u2019 all the pain. He said: \u2018Yes, of course it has and any Liberal Democrat will tell you that\u2026 we took the decision as a democratic party. And we decided that notwithstanding the impact on our short term political popularity it was the right thing for the country. \u2018And a time when people are so cynical about politics, and so fed up with politicians isn\u2019t it a good thing that a party, a plucky brave party put country before party and I have an old fashioned belief that if you do the right thing, that there are plenty of fair minded folk out there who will recognise that\u2026was every decision a decision I would relish?

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA father who walked out of a secretive Christian commune where everyone wears blue uniforms and birth control is non-existent said living in the community was like being in a scary thriller movie. Elijah Overcomer, 26, left Gloriavale, a town of about 500 on New Zealand's west coast,  with his wife, Rosanna, 29, and their children in late March 2013. Shortly following their departure, the family watched the 2004 psychological thriller The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan. Mr Overcomer said the film - where residents of a pretend 19th century town fear the 'wicked' outside world - was a 'good comparison with our community', especially in their views of the greater world. '(In the film), all the kids have grown up and been told the outside is unsafe. They even make their own scare tactics to scare people from going outside the wee village,' he said. 'It's kind of the same thing here. You're told if you leave Gloriavale you're lost, you lose your Salvation.' Life in Gloriavale: Wearing their customary blue uniforms, Elijah Overcomer, now 26, wife Rosanna, now 29 and two of the three children they left with are photographed inside the commune . Gloriavale baby: Daughter Honour is pictured decked out in her Gloriavale uniform . Young love: In Gloriavale blue, Elijah and Rosanna are pictured mucking around. Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune, is nestled on the banks of Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Living in the now: The Overcomers have lived outside Gloriavale for two years . Sharing candid photographs of his family's time in Gloriavale with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Overcomer said  he had been told there was 'a lot of sin' and 'bad things' in the greater world. 'You almost only get to know about the evil while you're there. 'That's all you know to be outside Gloriavale, is a lot of evil and that sort of thing.' But following their departure, the family were 'blown away' by the kindness and support shown to them by New Zealand churches in Christchurch and Timaru. The latter town, some 300kms south of Gloriavale, has become home to several former members of the sect recently following a virtual exodus. According to Sunday NZ program,  22 residents have left in the past two months. Among them includes the Ben Canaan family of 14, who famously walked out this March. 'When we left we received so much help and gifts from people especially churches at\u00a0Christchurch\u00a0and then at\u00a0Timaru,' Mr Overcomer told Daily Mail Australia. 'People (were) just helping us out giving us clothing, kitchen gear - heaps of stuff - and we were quite shocked with that. 'We've been blown away by how much love we've received outside of there. Even from people who aren't Christians, as well. 'There's a lot of really kind, caring people who want to help you. I mean, even in our district, you meet someone new and they just want to help. Just blown away. The family have faced two particular challenges leaving Gloriavale. The most devastating is that the couple are mostly unable to contact their large extended family inside the commune. 'Not being able to talk to them and see them is definitely the worst thing,' said Mr Overcomer, who is now managing a dairy farm and living in Timaru. 'Everyone can adapt into a different lifestyle. But you can't adapt from leaving your family.' A scene from the 2004 M. Night Shyamalan film, The Village. In the film, residents believed they were living in a 19th century village - but in reality the village had been founded in the 1970s . In an interview, Mr Overcomer compared the views residents in Gloriavale had of the outside world with those held in the psychological thriller The Village (above) l . Love in Gloriavale: Elijah is pictured here with Rosanna in scenic Gloriavale . One of the Overcomer's little boys, Seth, is pictured at Gloriavale . Love in Gloriavale: Rosanna is photographed here with three children, Seth (left), Zac and Honour . The deeply religious family were also forced to grapple with their views about Christianity. They were particularly afraid that, by walking out of Gloriavale they may have lost their 'Salvation' with God. 'I guess the biggest thing, other than leaving family, was feeling like our salvation was lost. 'For us, we felt that was the worst thing. Especially my wife really struggled with that. 'It wasn't until we got good teaching from the pastor at our church and he taught us through the Bible really well so we could be confident that Gloriavale was wrong and that we were actually free to go wherever we like... 'That really gave us a lot of security in what we've done. What we've been told wasn't true... You still have to tell yourself that.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.'' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.'Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms.The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels. Little Honour, pictured, grew up in Gloriavale and can be seen wearing her miniature blue uniform . Known by the name 'Hopeful Christian', Neville Cooper (pictured) was convicted of sex abuse and spent 11 months in prison in 1995 . Mr Overcomer was initially kicked out of the Gloriavale for five weeks around Christmas 2012 after 'asking too many questions' of the Elders, who rule the sect. Among the matters he asked about was the history of founder Neville Cooper, who was convicted and spent nearly a year imprisoned on sex abuse charges in 1995 . 'I don't know what really turned the corner with them. 'I guess the main thing is I even had the guts or whatever it was to ask them, to question it. 'It might seem strange looking in from out there. (But) growing up there you're real scared of them (the Elders), scared of getting in trouble with them. 'It was quite a courageous move to ask questions of them. Obviously I expected answers.' After five weeks of 'hell' separated from his family, Mr Overcomer 'repented' for his sins and returned home to Gloriavale. But the family soon decided to pick up and leave. In Gloriavale, women are required to wear a blue, full-length robe (pictured in a documentary above) Gloriavale families live together in large, communal hostels . One of the reasons the Overcomers decided to leave Gloriavale was to spend more time with their children, rather than them being 'raised as a part of a system' Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up. 'I worked outside Gloriavale, \"sharemilking\" on a neighbour's farm for the community. It was kind of then I thought I'd like my own house and things. 'And I'd like to look after my kids personally. There (in Gloriavale) your kids are raised by the system I guess. 'School, pre-school children go to pre-school - you don't really get a whole lot of time with them. 'With a farming lifestyle, you get to spend a bit more time with your children. You have a bigger input in their lives. Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up . Gloriavale is located on Lake Haupiri, on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island. Many families have left for Timaru, around 300kms south . He told Daily Mail Australia one of his 'biggest issues' with Gloriavale is how they separate dissenters from their families. 'That's the biggest thing I want to see stopped. I had a guy working for me for a while - he's got back in now. 'He was out for six months, away from his wife and family. He had three little children. 'It's that sort of behaviour I want to see stopped.' Mr Overcomer now manages a dairy farm with more than 700 cows. He said the family, who now have two more children, had 'definitely' adjusted to life in Timaru.\u00a0'We've been doing well.' Daily Mail Australia approached Gloriavale for comment but did not receive a response. The 'Ben Canaan' family of fourteen, pictured, left Gloriavale for Timaru in March 2015. Daily Mail Australia understands they have settled in well .",
    "text": "Elijah Overcomer, a former member of Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune in New Zealand, described life there as akin to a thriller movie, drawing parallels with the film \"The Village\" where residents fear the outside world. He left with his wife and children in 2013, seeking a life outside the strict confines where birth control is banned and everyone wears blue uniforms. The community, founded by Neville Cooper (later known as Hopeful Christian), is isolated and operates under strict religious control, with large families encouraged and limited contact with the outside world. Upon leaving, Overcomer and his family were surprised by the kindness and support they received from churches and communities in New Zealand. They faced challenges, particularly being cut off from their extended family within Gloriavale, and grappling with fears of losing their salvation. Overcomer criticized the community's separation of dissenters from their families and expressed a desire for change. Now settled in Timaru and managing a dairy farm, the Overcomer family has adjusted to their new life, appreciating the freedom and support they've found outside Gloriavale.",

A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly \u00a31million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just \u00a33,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her \u00a31million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent \u00a31,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made \u00a3940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud . Abdulhamid was jailed for six years after admitting three counts of conspiracy to defraud, but this year he was ordered to repay just \u00a3686 out of the \u00a374,000 profit he made from the scam. During a raid of Oshodi's home, detectives discovered computers with details of more than 11,000 credit cards, including those of almost 8,500 UK customers. In a victim impact statement, Ms Budow said she was 'physically shaking' when she was informed by the bank, adding: 'Since the theft I have been reimbursed the full amount by Santander. 'But the effect it has had on me personally has been one of complete violation of my privacy. People have gained access to my personal details and I fear what they will use the information for.' Jabeth and five others were also jailed for being involved in the scam.",

The former Light Blues midfielder steered his new side to their third victory on the bounce with Sunday's 2-1 win over Hearts. It was a crucial triumph that moves Gers back into second place in the Scottish Championship and looks to have restored vital momentum ahead of the end-of-season play-offs. Stuart McCall says he was warned not to take the Rangers job but is pleased that he took the risk in the end . McCall has managed to unite a forlorn band of players since taking over a month ago and quickly transformed them into real promotion contenders. But he has revealed nine-in-a-row boss Smith - who McCall says was the 'greatest manager' he ever worked for - called to make sure the former Scotland international knew what he was letting himself in for when he agreed to replace Kenny McDowall. McCall, who still does not know if he will remain in charge beyond the summer, told TalkSport: 'Walter Smith rung me up on the day I took the job and asked if I knew what I'd let myself in for. 'But in fairness, he understood I would never have got the opportunity to manage such a wonderful club like this [were it not for the club's current circumstances]. The Gers boss has seen his new side win their last three games in a row including a crucial win over Hearts . 'Even though I knew it was a gamble and the pitfalls, just to be part of it has been great. 'Regardless of what happens at the end of the season, I have relished every minute of it and I'm thoroughly enjoying it, especially with the results being good.' Rangers' promotion hopes looked to have crumbled earlier this season as previous bosses Ally McCoist and McDowall struggled to maintain the required levels of morale and confidence amid the din generated by the club's bitter off-field civil war. Dave King's boardroom coup saw McCall brought in to rally the troops and his impact has been impressive. Kenny Miller (centre) fires home the opening goal for Rangers during Sunday's Scottish Championship game . Newly-crowned Scottish Championship winners Hearts were clapped on to the pitch by the home players at Ibrox. But it was Rangers who left the field to cheers after clinging onto victory after playing the entire second half a man down following skipper Lee McCulloch's red card just before the break. Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic netted a pair of clinical strikes and McCall believes the quality of his side's goals only proves that the feel-good factor has returned to Glasgow's south side. He told the Rangers website: 'They were brilliant and the first was a good move down the left. On-loan Haris Vuckic (centre) curls home his sides second goal at Ibrox to put them in command . 'I think everyone knows Lee Wallace's capabilities when he gets forwards. Nicky Law has played him in with a good weighted pass and it was a great cutback and a fantastic finish by Kenny. He is just playing off Nicky Clark at the moment and doing it really well. 'The second goal is why Haris played today. He's got a goal in him, he's a threat. He can come in on his left foot and do what he did so it didn't surprise me when he picked it up there that it ended up in the back of the net. 'I felt for him at half-time. I explained to him that we had to bring him off and it was nothing to do with his performance, it was just because of the change of shape. 'He took it well, he understands, but what is good in the dressing room is that it's not just the 11 or the 14. There's about 22 lads and staff and everybody in there was congratulating each other for that performance. It's good to keep the momentum, the belief and the confidence high.' The Slovenian celebrates his goal as he continues to impress during his spell from Newcastle United . Rangers take on Queen of the South at Palmerston on Thursday night and McCall is expecting another battle after Gers lost 2-0 under McCoist's charge the last time they visited in December. He said: 'I saw Queen of the South against Hibs and they are well organised and we know what happened the last time we were down there. 'It was a tough night so they'll be confident as well after their victory. But the momentum carries on and we are going to have to be at our best on Thursday.'",

An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. The craft was supposed to be capturing footage of the Royal Burgers Zoo chimp enclosure for a TV show. Watch the video here . Look out! An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. Following the attack, the drone crashes to the ground - only for the chimp to pounce on it . 'On the morning of Friday, April 10, 2015, the chimpanzees of Royal Burgers' Zoo once again proved how intelligent they are,' a spokesman for the zoo said. The incident happened during filming for a reality show set in the zoo. Programme makers had hoped to use the drone to capture the enclosure from above. 'Today, for the second season of the national television program Burgers' Zoo Natuurlijk, film takes were planned with a drone, with which spectacular images of the animals and their habitats could be made from above.' The drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure. 'Once the drone arrived at the chimpanzee quarters the intelligent primates immediately discovered the spying little plane and right away armed themselves with long sticks against this inquisitive electronic intruder,' the zaoo revealed. One of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch. 'Apparently very calm and satisfied, half asleep in the morning sun, the primate let the drone make its curious images. 'Until..... the drone got just a bit too close. Once grounded, the chimp investigates its prey, taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off. 'Like a flash the chimpanzee struck out with the long stick she had held hidden behind her body. With a direct hit the animal knocked the drone to the ground, where the group of primates quickly overpowered the 'prey'. 'With much enjoyment they very efficiently dismantled the play thing.

Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job. She has faced mounting pressure from Congress, where some questioned her competence in the wake of a scathing government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes. DEA head Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday, as she faces mounting criticism from Congress that she's been unable to change the agency's culture . Leonhart was widely criticized for her response to the report and a group of lawmakers said in a statement that she was 'woefully unable to change' the agency's culture. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not yet been made. Lawmakers have been pushing for Leonhart's ouster since her disastrous appearance before the House Oversight Committee last week. A majority of the committee said they had lost confidence in her and said she 'lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their positions.' The Justice Department report that jeopardized Leonhart's job recounted allegations that drug agents attended sex parties with prostitutes, some funded by local drug cartels, in a foreign country. The DEA said the incidents happened in Colombia. Several Congressional members have criticized Leonhart's competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes . The no-confidence statement was signed by 13 House Democrats and nine Republicans, including Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and the committee's top Democrat. Chaffetz went a step further, calling for Leonhart to resign or be fired. Last week, the White House voiced concerns about the Justice Department report. In a daily press briefing Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on reports that Leonhart was set to leave the agency and instead reiterated that the Obama administration had 'concerns about the material that was presented in the (inspector general) report that raised legitimate and serious questions about the conduct of some DEA officers. 'The president, as you know, maintains a very high standard for anybody who serves in his administration, particularly when it comes to law enforcement officials. And the I.G. report raised serious concerns about that conduct,' Earnest said. Leonhart has previously been the target of online petitions calling for her ouster after she distanced herself from the administration's stance on legalized marijuana, seen as a hands-off approach that lets states legalize marijuana so long as it is state regulated. In an email sent to employees last Friday, Leonhart lamented agent's 'disgraceful conduct' Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and is classified by the DEA as a Schedule 1 drug, along with drugs such as heroin and peyote. Leonhart also declined to fully endorse sentencing reform efforts supported by the Justice Department. CNN reports that Leonart sent an email to employees last Friday lamenting the recent scandals. 'This has been a very difficult week for DEA, with members of Congress and the media asking tough questions and sharing our outrage about the disgraceful conduct of a few individuals several years ago.' she wrote. 'This employee misconduct has upset me for many reasons, but especially because it calls into question the incredible reputation DEA has built over more than 40 years.' She ended the email thanking employees 'for your continued expressions of trust and confidence as we navigate through these rough waters. I know you will remain focused on our mission and the commitment to excellence that is the hallmark of who we are, and what we will always be at DEA.'",
    "text": "DEA head Michele Leonhart is expected to resign soon following mounting pressure from Congress over a report revealing DEA agents' involvement in sex parties with prostitutes.

Critics, including House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, called for her resignation or firing. While the White House expressed concern over the report's findings, Leonhart faced additional criticism for her stance against marijuana legalization and sentencing reform, both of which diverge from the Obama administration's position.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nWashington (CNN)Judge Jeffrey Sutton doesn't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days. Sutton, who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage. His opinion, issued in November, goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans. The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. \"It's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship,\" said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. Sutton \"more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made, and then one by one by one, he explains why it doesn't work.\" Critics call the opinion an outlier and don't believe it will carry much weight, considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \"Judge Sutton's opinion stands alone,\" said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. Sutton, 54, is the former state solicitor for Ohio, where he handled appeals for the state's attorney general. He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton \"one of the very best law clerks I ever had.\" Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states' rights. Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday. It is \"dangerous and demeaning,\" Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges \"can fairly understand\" the arguments for and against same-sex marriage. \"Isn't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups?\" he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook, also a Bush appointee. Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning. \"The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,\" Davidson said. \"They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution.\" Sutton pointed  to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment. \"Nobody in this case,\" he wrote, \"argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\" It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution. \"From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,\" he wrote, noting that the \"Fourteenth Amendment permits, though does not require, States to define marriage that way.\" He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy. \"By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.\" He said that states should not be accused of \"irrationality,\" but only the awareness that same-sex couples don't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex. Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples. He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by \"real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores.\" Gene Schaerr, a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, calls Sutton's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans. \"He's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another,\" Schaerr said. But attached to Sutton's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Bill Clinton appointee, dismissed the opinion as an \"engrossing TED talk\" and a \"largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism.\" Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals \"suffering actual harm.\" \"These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens, \" she wrote, but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status. Her harshest language was for Sutton's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process. \"If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\"",

According to eyewitnesses at Benihana's Japanese Restaurant in Encino, California, Tori, hubby Dean McDermott, their kids, Liam, Stella, Hattie and Finn, and a few other guests, had enjoyed their Easter brunch, when Tori tripped and fell onto a hot Japanese style grill used to prepare food in front of customers. Tori had been laughing and having fun with her family at Easter brunch,' says a source, 'when she got up to leave and tripped, falling backwards on to a scorching hot grill. She shouted out in pain from a large burn on the back of her right arm. Scroll down for video . White hot: Tori Spelling was a trouper and stuck through her family brunch at Benihana restaurant in LA. But once outside she was seen inspecting the bad burn on her right arm . Tori's doctor's determined she had a severe burn and suggested they remove the damaged skin and graft skin from another area of the body, a source tells Daily Mail Online. 'She questioned if it was absolutely necessary but doctors said she risked severe infection and scarring if she didn't act right away' Tori was eventually taken to the Grossman Burn Center at the West Hills Hospital for treatment. It was determined that she needed skin grafts . 'You could tell she was hurting, but she was trying to put on a brave face for the sake of her four young children who were quite obviously worried,' says the source. 'Dean looked upset too, but you could tell they were doing their best to stay calm and not alarm the children.' Tori posted this cryptic message on her Instagram following the incident: \u00a0Perfect @Easter Sunday. Aside from the Benihana Burn! According to sources, Spelling went home and tried nursing her injury herself, but by the following day she was in so much pain she went to her doctor who ordered her to immediately undergo treatment at the Grossman Burn Center in West Hills, California.

And just last week rumors began circulating that her 48-year-old husband may have cheated on her once again \u2013 this time with his 52-year-old ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace. 'Tori could certainly use a bit of good luck in her life for a change,' says the source.

The site told Daily Mail Online that 'after review by our team, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of GoFundMe's terms & conditions' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns. Slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father Walter Scott, 50, who was fatally shot five times in the back in North Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday. Slager, 33, was terminated from the police force on Wednesday. A separate fundraising campaign was started on site, Indiegogo, titled the 'Michael T. Slager Support Fund' and featured a picture of Slager in his police uniform. As of Thursday at 11am, it had raised $393 of a $5,000 goal on donations from 20 people after being set up on Wednesday. Two hours later, that total had jumped to $541. Scroll down for video . An Indiegogo page  to raise money in support of police officer Michael Slager had $393 of a $5,000 goal on Thursday - the company told Daily Mail Online 'they don't judge' as long as content fits their terms of use . A well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on Indiegogo and listed their name as 'trayvon' - perhaps in a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012 . Officer Michael Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott's body and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance . Opening fire: Michael Slager, a police officer in Charleston, South Carolina, was caught on video shooting dead 50-year-old black man Walter Scott after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light on Saturday . One of the individuals who donated listed their name as 'Trayvon' - perhaps a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. An explanation of the fundraising campaign reads: 'We're campaigning to show our Support for Officer Michael T. Slager! 'We believe in all of our LEOs and want to publicly support them! Although he may have made mis-steps in judgement he was protecting the community. 'Michael is a former Coast Guardsman with two stepchildren and a wife who is expecting a child, served for more than five years with the department without being disciplined. Please help in any way you can.' Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was a U.S. Coast Guard veteran. Police officer Michael Sagler, (pictured right in his prison mugshot), who has been charged with his murder also was a member of the Coast Guard . A Facebook page was set up to support the cop who has been charged with murder and terminated from the police force . The statement then repeated: 'He has served five years with the department without being disciplined.' A separate Facebook page and Twitter account were set up linking to the fundraising site. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person, who tweeted: 'We're not here to judge wrong or right, there are two sides to every story. Let the courts decide after careful review.' The social media pages attracted dozens of negative comments. Marquese Lewis posted on the Facebook page supporting Slager: 'How about the real reason is you are an ignorant racist supporting a murderer.' Bruce A McIntyre added: 'If he cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint a Public Defender for him. Surely he is fine with that, as that is all most of his arrestees ever get.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, an Indiegogo spokesperson said: 'Indiegogo allows anyone, anywhere to fund ideas that matter to them and just like other open platforms -- such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - we don\u2019t judge the content of campaigns as long as they are in compliance with our Terms of Use.' Indiegogo's list 'Prohibited Campaigns' includes those 'to raise funds for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others'. The rules state: 'Campaign Owners shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Campaigns.' The crowd-funding 'community guidelines go further and explain the website is not a place for 'hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam'. It reads on: 'Do not use to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.' A Twitter account also supported Michael Slager after he fatally shot a father-of-four. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person . On Wednesday, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said that Slager's wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive health insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do'. Last year, GoFundMe came under fire after allowing fundraising for Darren Wilson, a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In five days, people gave half a million-dollars to two fundraising pages for Wilson. The page has since been removed. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force but was not charged with any crime after a grand jury hearing.",

The Indiegogo campaign, which emphasized Slager's clean record and family situation, drew criticism and comparisons to the Trayvon Martin case, with one donation sarcastically listed as \"trayvon.\" Critics questioned the ethics of supporting a police officer charged with murder, while supporters emphasized due process and the need to support law enforcement.

A bad-tempered managing director repeatedly punched his wife in the face after he shouted at her for not doing the ironing.

His wife threw all his shirts outside, but he followed her and shouted at her before he pulled her hair and punched her several times in the face. Neighbours called the police after Bulman drove away, damaging a gate post and a van, leaving his frightened wife with a black eye and a lump on her head. Bulman was given a 12-month community order after he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court. Recorder Jim Tindal also ordered Bulman to complete rehabilitation and programme requirements, and not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nThe pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories . Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty . Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Despite a slight downgrade for 2016 \u2013 the IMF\u2019s initial forecast was 2.4 per cent \u2013 this is still enough for Britain to leave other EU nations trailing in its wake.

The World Economic Outlook report, which was published yesterday, will be seen as a boost for the Conservatives ahead of next month\u2019s General Election. The Fund also appeared to back Tory plans to return Britain to the black after years of borrowing and rising debt. It will come as another blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who has pledged to bring traditionally Left-wing policies back to Britain \u2013 mirroring the actions of Francois Hollande in France. The French president swept to power in 2012 promising to take on the rich and big business, but the country\u2019s economy has been in a rut ever since.

The 34-year-old reality star explained that she is creating an 'archive' of her most infamous outfits, which she stores in clear plastic bags, because she is keen on the idea of North inheriting her wardrobe when she gets older. '[\u2018I\u2019m saving] every last piece,\u2019 Kim told The Huffington Post\u00a0of her most memorable designer ensembles. \u2018Everything. I have a full archive. The dress that I wore on the cover of Vogue will be hers. All of my Met Gala dresses.' Scroll down for video . Family values: Kim, who is pictured with her smiling daughter North West, revealed that the 22-month-old will inherit her entire wardrobe when she gets older . Mini-me: Kim Kardashian and her 22-month-old daughter North West wear matching back while sightseeing in\u00a0Armenia . The mother-of-one added: 'I keep everything and put it in these clear plastic bags altogether with the shoes - the whole look of what I wore.' As Kim named her Givenchy wedding dress, which she wore last May to wed Kanye West in Florence, Italy, as the 'prize piece' in her clothing collection, it\u2019s likely that the one-of-a-kind gown will also be handed down to her young daughter one day. Kim credited her husband for 'introducing' her to the fashion world and added that she wants their daughter to follow in their footsteps and be confident in what she wears. She added: 'I took a lot of direction from my husband when he introduced me more to the fashion world. And now I love taking risks. I love wearing things that maybe I couldn\u2019t quite understand at the time.' And Kim maintained that she loves all forms of personal style as long as it's unique to the individual. 'I just love when someone has their own style - even if it\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t wear,' she said. 'So I would just encourage North to be herself and wear what she thinks she looks good in. Just be yourself and take risks.' Hot mommy: The 34-year-old, pictured in a figure-hugging nude skirt, said she thinks she dresses sexier now that is a mother . Kim also admitted that she is usually responsible for dressing North, she said the 37-year-old rapper always finds something 'super cute' for their little girl to wear. 'I love when he picks out her clothes,' she explained. 'I know if I go downstairs to make breakfast and ask him to get her dressed that she\u2019ll come down looking super cute. But usually I pretty much pick out her outfits.' And with a mother as glamorous and as make-up savvy as Kim, it's no surprise that North is already developing an obsession with beauty products - and shoes. Last week, The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star spoke with\u00a0Elle.com\u00a0about her daughter's budding independence and style preferences while sharing her approach to being a businesswoman, mother, wife and dressing\u00a0her post-baby body. '[North] is obsessed with make-up and watching me get ready and getting ready herself,' Kim told the website. 'She just loves the process. She could not be more ultimately girly-girl.' Family time: Kim can be seen holding North's hand while she and Kanye tour Armenia . Stellar style: North wore a black fringed dress, black combat boots and an olive green jacket while out with her parents . The mother-of-one noted that after she gives North, who will turn two in June, a bath her adorable daughter always asks for her 'purse' because she really wants to grab her mom's make-up bag, which is inside. Kim said that if she turns around for a second, North will have her lipstick 'all over her face', so she had to give her a 'little make-up bag' of her own. Not surprisingly, the reality TV star, who often matches North's outfits to her own, admitted that she likes it when kid's wear 'mini-me styles' and she loves 'seeing kids in black'. While Kim insisted that North 'gravitates towards really simple things' when it comes to clothing, she noted that her little girl 'loves accessories'. According to Kim, the toddler always requests a pair of shoes to wear first thing in the morning. She added that North 'just discovered backpacks so she loves to put them on'. In fact, North loves luggage in general. The precious tot, who has been photographed lugging a small Frozen-themed suitcase through the airport, always tries to take her mom's luggage. Holiday spirit: North donned a flower and a white ensemble that matched her mother's dress when the Kardashian family went to church on Easter . Matching looks: Kim and North donned neutral coats during a trip to the airport . 'We got the Frozen suitcase so she has to carry it everywhere,' she explained. 'It took us about 30 minutes longer to get through the airport because she had to carry her suitcase herself.\u2019 She noted that North didn't want to be picked up, adding: 'She's very independent . Kim believes that her daughter's independence may have to do with the fact she was adamant about North sleeping in her own room - and now that's where she prefers to be. 'She kind of likes to be in her own room and that has allowed [Kanye and I] to have our time together,' she said. Kim said that she doesn't want to tell anyone how to parent, but it was important to her as a new mom that she set boundaries and dedicate five to ten percent of her day to herself in order to maintain her sanity. In sync: North, who loves accessories, was photographed wearing a YSL bag to the airport and striped pants that matched her mom's button-down shirt . 'It worked for me to be able to get my work out in, make me feel good about myself, put my daughter down to bed at a decent time, and have the night with my husband,' she said. And because those post-baby workouts helped her get back in shape, she has a newfound confidence that has inspired her to flaunt her body in cleavage-baring tops and figure-hugging dresses. '[I think I dress] sexier now than I did before,' she said of her mommy style. Kim, who helped her sisters Kourtney and Khloe launch their latest Kardashian Kids children's collection at Nordstrom.com on Monday, noted that she always gives 100per cent of herself to every project she takes on. 'Nothing comes easy,' she said. 'I know that people joke all the time and try to figure out, you know, what it is that I do, but I work really hard. I get up every day at 5 a.m. and start my day.'",

But a group of scientists from the University of Alberta in Canada claim to have settled the debate once and for all. Their study finds the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones. Research found that the cracking is caused by the rapid formation of a gas-filled cavity within a slippery substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the space between the finger bones . The study also found that the knuckle cracks in less than 310 milliseconds and that immediately before the popping sound there is a white flash, believed to be from water rushing together. The experiment was made possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u2013 which provides detailed images of internal body structures \u2013 and was humorously dubbed by those involved as the \u2018pull my finger study.\u2019 Biomedical engineering professor Richard Thompson said: \u2018Rapid imaging with MRI was ideal for these studies because it allowed clear visualization of the bones and fluids surrounding them, and critically, the formation of the air cavity.\u2019 One of the study's co-authors, chiropractor Jerome Fryer, was used as the guinea pig for the experiment and lent his own knuckles to the cause.

But nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45-minute meal . Abedin keeps a low profile, a choice that a Democratic Party insider said is the product of two problems. 'First, you never want to be more famous than your boss,' the source explained on Wednesday. 'And then there's the Weiner problem.' Abedin is married to disgraced former New York Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose spectacular fall from grace came after he was exposed for sending lurid Twitter messages to women \u2013 including one of his barely covered genitalia. She stood by him through the embarrassment and through his resignation from Congress. Weiner ran for Mayor of New York City last year, only to see his stock tumble with a second round of sexting allegations, this time confirmed by the woman he was exchanging racy messages with. 'Scooby' is a customized and armored Chevy van that Clinton and her top staffers occupied during a 1,000-mile trip from New York to Iowa this week . EMAIL-GATE: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin and Weiner have a 2-year-old child together. After she returned from maternity leave in June 2012, the State Department made a special accommodation for her that is now the subject of an inspector general accommodation. Abedin was permitted to shift her employment classification from 'employee' to 'Special Government Employee,' a perk that allowed her to have a second income while drawing a government salary. That moonlight gig was at Teneo Holdings, a corporate consulting firm founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton confidant. The State Department paid Abedin $135,000 per year to work part-time from her New York City home. Teneo paid her an additional $355,000 via an annual contract. The whopping combined income helped her household stay financially afloat in the wake of Weiner's resignation, and his loss of a congressional salary.",

This is according to a British study that has discovered a catastrophic condition called 'marine photic zone euxinia' took place in one of the prehistoric oceans. This happens when the sun-lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulphide. Life of the Triassic met a choking end in a runaway greenhouse climate, heating the seas into warm stagnation, according to a new study. Pictured is an artist's impression of what may have happened in the oceans 200 million years ago. \u00a0The study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences . Hydrogen sulphide is a by-product of micro-organisms that live without oxygen and is extremely toxic to most other lifeforms. The study authors fear that the planet today could suffer similar consequences caused by the amount of carbon dioxide being created through the burning of fossil fuels. A team lead by the University of Southampton studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north-eastern Panthalassic Ocean, which surrounded the continent of Pangaea. The rocks are now exposed on the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. A team lead by the University of Southampton studied fossilised organic molecules taken from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north-eastern Panthalassic Ocean. The rocks are now exposed on the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the coast of British Columbia, Canada . The experts found signs of bacteria which had suffered severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulphide poisoning which would have been caused by massive volcanic rifts in the Earth's tectonic plates. 'As tectonic plates shifted to break up Pangaea, huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect,' said Professor Jessica Whiteside. 'The rapid rises in CO2 would have triggered changes in ocean circulation, acidification and deoxygenation. The\u00a0Panthalassic Ocean\u00a0was the vast global ancestral Pacific ocean that surrounded the supercontinent Pangaea, during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras . 'These changes have the potential to disrupt nutrient cycles and alter food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems. Our data now provides direct evidence that anoxic, and ultimately euxinic, conditions severely affected food chains. 'The same CO2 rise that led to the oxygen-depleted oceans also led to a mass extinction on land, and ultimately to the ecological takeover by dinosaurs, although the mechanisms are still under study.' She explained that although the Earth was very different during the Triassic period, the rate of carbon dioxide release from volcanic rifts are similar to those we are experiencing now through the burning of fossil fuels. Professor Whiteside added: 'The release of CO2 was probably at least as rapid as that caused by the burning of fossil fuels today, although the initial concentrations were much higher in the Triassic. 'The consequences of rapidly rising CO2 in ancient times inform us of the possible consequences of our own carbon dioxide crisis.' Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction -\u00a0375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event.\u00a022 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species.",
    "text": "A British study suggests that the Earth may currently be experiencing biochemical shifts similar to those that led to the mass extinction 200 million years ago, during the Triassic-Jurassic period. This ancient extinction was caused by a condition called 'marine photic zone euxinia,' where ocean surface waters lost oxygen and were poisoned by hydrogen sulphide, triggered by volcanic activity and rising CO2 levels. Researchers from the University of Southampton found evidence of such conditions in sedimentary rocks from the Panthalassic Ocean, now located on Canada's Queen Charlotte Islands. The study indicates that the rapid CO2 increase from volcanic rifts back then parallels the current rise due to fossil fuel burning, potentially leading to similar catastrophic environmental changes. Historical mass extinctions, such as the Ordovician-Silurian, Late Devonian, Permian, Triassic-Jurassic, and Cretaceous-Tertiary events, have been linked to significant environmental shifts and underscore the potential threat of current CO2 emissions.",

Caitlin Kellie-Jones suffered from Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE), a type of brain damage that occurs when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood. To control the condition Caitlin was placed in a special cooling wrap within 40 minutes of her birth to keep her at the target temperature of 33.5 degrees for 72 hours. Nicola Kellie-Jones and partner Paul with children Caitlin and Dylan are raising money to help other children . Medics gave little Caitlin, pictured, hypothermia in a bid to prevent any brain damage . Caitlin, pictured, was diagnosed with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy minutes after she was born . It allows the brain to cool down and minimises the damage from the lack of oxygen. Thankfully, Caitlin, now ten months old, recovered from HIE and is able to feed and play. Her parents, Nicola and Paul, are hoping it will not have affected her ability to walk and talk but they must wait to find out. Ms Kellie-Jones,  27, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: 'Caitlin was in an incubator surrounded by doctors and nurses. 'She wasn't moving or breathing for herself, and was making no noise. 'I had an image in my mind of our first cuddle which was taken away. Doctors were telling us she was very poorly and just to take it hour by hour. 'It was such a relief to bring her home.' Caitlin was born on May 10 last year weighing 7lbs 4oz after a normal pregnancy. She was whisked away by doctors immediately to be placed on a specialist cooling machine. Despite her ordeal, Caitlin, who is now 10 months old, seems to be developing normally . Ms Kellie-Jones, right, wants to raise \u00a316,000 for additional cooling machines to help save other babies . Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'My mum was a neonatal nurse for many years and I often visited her at work and would see all of these babies in their little incubators and see families in and out visiting their babies, but I never imagined it would be me. Ms Kellie-Jones said the next important stage is whether she will be able to walk and talk normally . 'We couldn't look to the days ahead and my mum told me to take lots of pictures. I knew what they were all trying to tell me, everyone thought she wouldn't make it. 'I didn't move from her side for hours. I had the doctors and nurses tell me the worst case scenario so I could prepare myself, but it was very upsetting to hear she might not make it. 'Paul was the opposite, he wanted to know the best possible outcome. 'We were lucky that we were able to get Caitlin on one of the machines, otherwise we might not have been bringing her home.' Caitlin was born and treated at Royal Preston Hospital, where there are only two cooling machines available. Ms Kellie-Jones said: 'We are extremely lucky that the last cooling machine was available for our daughter that day. 'I'm trying to raise money now for two cerebral function machines for the hospital, which monitor brain activity for any signs of brain damage, and, if I raise enough, another cooling machine for the neonatal unit. 'My target is to raise at least \u00a316,000. 'Her brother Dylan, 10, is doing a sponsored bike ride with his granddad to help too. 'At his age he could have thought what happened to Caitlin was normal, but he came to see her every night and loves her to pieces.' Caitlin will need follow up appointments until she is two, but it is hoped she will make a full recovery. To donate go to: www.justgiving.com/CaitlinsCoolingCause .

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA government inquiry is to be carried out into the impact of migrant children arriving in schools unable to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan revealed she has ordered officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on the state schools system. It comes less than six months after she told the head of Ofsted it was not 'helpful' to warn that schools are struggling to cope with an 'influx' of migrants. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan revealed she has ordered officials to start 'mapping the pressures' on the state schools system caused by immigration . Immigration has played a low-key role in the Tory election campaign to date, after David Cameron spectacularly to meet his pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. The Tory leader vowed to cut the number below 100,000 'no ifs, no buts', but latest figures show the number hit 298,000 in the year to September. In an interview today Mrs Morgan admitted it is a 'big issue' for voters and revealed she has asked the Department for Education to examine the impact on schools. It is expected to look at how migrant children perform in exams and how schools with large immigrant populations cope. Mrs Morgan told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I think there is pressure in the classrooms in terms of teaching \u2014 how prepared [immigrant] children are when they start school. Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw last year warned schools had faced an 'influx' of immigrants . 'It would be wrong to say immigration holds results back or affects overall qualifications ultimately. But at the start of primary school, especially, it means that teachers have to tailor their lessons, to spend longer with pupils who have English as a second language. 'We are looking at that in the Department \u2014 exactly mapping the pressures, what teachers have to do, the resources that takes. I am very keen to know.' She added that she wanted to ensure that migrant children have caught up with other pupils before the end of the Year 1, aged six or seven. In October last year, Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw was challenged about the increased worked of teachers caused by a large number of children who could not speak English. Sir Michael said: 'Schools need the resources to deal with that. 'When they're faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it, and if those resources aren't there, that's a big issue for government. That's the first thing and we'll be producing reports on this fairly soon.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . But a week later Mrs Morgan questioned Sir Michael's language and played down the scale of the problem. 'Obviously Sir Michael Wilshaw has gone round to various schools but no, when I go round schools I see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad. 'I am not sure that sort of language is always helpful but there are challenges and there are parts of the country where we know that there are higher numbers of students who don't speak English as a first language.' Asked whether Sir Michael should have chosen his words more carefully, Mrs Morgan added: 'This whole area of immigration is an area where we need to be very careful about the language that we use. 'It isn't that it isn't a concern to people because it absolutely is but we also need to think about the language and the tone of the debate that we use. 'We need to tackle the issue in a sensitive way without saying there isn't a problem because people are clearly concerned about it.' Everyone who comes to Britain should know how to speak English, Labour Ed Miliband has warned as he admitted Labour made mistakes on immigration. The Labour leader admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language. But the Tories said there was nothing in Mr Miliband's plans to act to reduce the number of people moving to Britain, after net migration hit 298,000 in a year. Ed Miliband\u00a0admitted that in the past his party had been 'too timid' about making clear that for communities to live together they must use a shared language . Mr Miliband pledged a new crackdown on illegal exploitation of migrant workers, promising a Home Office task force to boost prosecutions and fines on bad employers. Speaking in Wirral West - a marginal seat held by the Tory Employment Minister Esther McVey - the Labour leader said exploitation drives low skilled migration and holds down wages for British workers. His new unit of 100 staff will bring together people from the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and specialist police units, together with additional Home Office enforcement staff. The unit will be empowered to investigate abuse and be challenged to increase prosecutions and fines levelled against employers who break the rules. But he also warned that migrants must learn to speak English, especially in key services like the NHS. Mr Miliband said: 'Our communities are changing fast but we don't cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds. Instead we must find a way to live together across communities. 'A Britain where people of all backgrounds, all cultures, all religions, can practise their own faiths but also come together to forge a common identity. 'But we can only build this shared society if we speak the same language.' He said his own parents had learned to speak English after arriving from Belgium in 1940. 'It is why I believe in a simple principle: Everyone in Britain should know how to speak English. 'Sometimes, we've been too timid about this but it is something we should expect from everyone who comes here. 'And it is especially important that people who work in public services in public facing roles should be required to speak English.' He said that 'nowhere is that more true' than in the health service. 'We all know the crucial contribution that people from overseas play in our NHS. Doctors, paramedics, social workers, nurses. Bringing specialist skills that we need. 'I will never demean or devalue their contribution to our country. 'But it is vital that people who come to fulfil these roles don't just have the right medical skills, but can communicate with those for whom they care. 'So in the future all healthcare professionals will be required to speak English to a sufficient standard so they can care effectively for patients.'",
    "text": "The UK government is launching an inquiry into the impact of migrant children who don't speak English entering the state school system. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan wants to understand the pressures schools face, including how teachers are adapting lessons, the resources required, and the academic performance of these children. This follows a debate sparked by Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw, who warned about schools struggling with an \"influx\" of migrant children. While acknowledging public concern about immigration, Morgan wants a measured discussion, emphasizing the need for migrant children to learn English, especially those in public-facing roles like healthcare. This reflects a broader political debate, with Labour leader Ed Miliband also calling for all immigrants to learn English while pledging to crack down on the exploitation of migrant workers.",

But 11-month-old babies have already mastered the fundamentals of physics. Baby boys and girls were surprised when a ball seemed to disappear through a solid wall. Their curiosity did not end there. When they were then given the ball to play with, they repeatedly banged it on a table in an apparent attempt to work out its secret. Scroll down for video . Babies in the study reacted with surprise when objects like this toy car appeared to break the laws of gravity . The babies were similarly perplexed by a toy car that appeared to defy the laws of gravity and float in thin air. And given it to play with later, they repeatedly dropped it on the floor. Importantly, the babies shown the magic tricks were more interested in playing with the ball than a brand new toy that they had never seen before. Babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old. A study by psychologists at the University of Missouri\u00a0has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander. In an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected. The findings indicated the newborns had \u2018strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others\u2019, the researchers said. And they did better than others on a learning test, in which they had to link a specific sound to the ball. This, say the US researchers, suggests that babies learn from the unexpected, something that is important in a world in which we are constantly bombarded with information. Professor Lisa Feigenson, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said: \u2018For young learners, the world is an incredibly complex place filled with dynamic stimuli. \u2018How do learners know what to focus on and what to learn more about and what to ignore? \u2018Our research suggests that infants use what they already know about the world to form predictions. \u2018When these predictions are shown to be wrong, infants use this as a special opportunity for learning. \u2018When babies are surprised, they learn much better, as though they are taking the occasion to try to figure something out about their world.\u2019 The professor studied 11-month-olds because they were old enough to sit and watch the ball and to pick it up and play with it. A ball was rolled down a slope and apparently passed through a solid wall in one magic trick in the study . Babies repeatedly droped the car after being shown the magic trick as they attempted to learn what happened . However, previous studies have shown that much younger babies and newborn animals have surprising amounts of knowledge about maths and physics, including whether an object should be able to pass through a solid wall. Writing in the journal Science, she said that some information may be so fundamental to survival that we are born with it. Lead author Aimee Stahl said that young babies are \u2018remarkably sophisticated thinkers\u2019. She added: \u2018It\u2019s easy to look at a baby and see a blank slate but actually babies have rich, sophisticated expectations about the world. \u2018Infants are not only equipped with core knowledge about fundamental aspects of the world but, from early in their lives, they harness this knowledge to empower new learning.\u2019 After seeing the ball trick babies would bang it on the table more as they attempted to uncover its secrets . The graphic above shows the reactions of the babies after seeing magic tricks that defied their expectations . The babies in the study were given choices about the toys they would play with after watching a magic trick . Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a study published last summer. Psychologists at King\u2019s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds who were identical ans non-identical twins. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King\u2019s College London, said: \u2018Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. \u2018Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what\u2019s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species\u2019 ability to store information and build a civilisation.\u2019",

Some patients are even being given hangover tablets and Yakult yogurt drinks. Critics said it was \u2018ludicrous\u2019 that such items were being handed out when the NHS was rationing routine treatments. It has prompted concern that patients are abusing the system by demanding prescriptions for household essentials which are cheaply available at their local chemist. The figures came on the day that Britain was ranked only 27th in the world for health and wellness \u2013 below Slovenia, Spain and Portugal \u2013 and 111th out of 133 countries for obesity. In 2014, the NHS handed out 404,500 prescriptions for suncream at a cost of \u00a313million.

Other bathroom cabinet items routinely being prescribed by GPs include Calpol, Vaseline, Strepsils and toothpaste, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: \u2018This is ludicrous. Every week we hear of patients being denied another cancer treatment or refused cataracts while others are being prescribed toothpaste. Whoever is prescribing this or authorising it must have completely lost their mind.\u2019 Doctors admit that some patients abuse the system and arrive at surgeries with shopping\u00a0lists of toiletries and remedies. But their contract states they must prescribe any medication they think is \u2018necessary\u2019, meaning patients can claim that most remedies are needed even if they are cheaply available from a chemist. The NHS is facing a huge black hole in its finances, with chief executive Simon Stevens predicting that by 2020/21, there will be a gap of at least \u00a38billion in its annual budget. Only last month it stopped providing funding for 19 life-extending cancer treatments because there was not enough money to pay for all the patients who needed them. The NHS has also been forced to ration many routine treatments which are considered to be non-urgent, such as hip and knee replacements and cataract operations. Dr Anita Sharma, a senior GP in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said patients come into her surgery every week wanting prescriptions for head lice shampoo, which can be bought for \u00a35 from the chemist. \u2018We need to take a different approach to prescribing,\u2019 she said. \u2018Primary care must focus on ensuring the use of the right medicine, for the right patient and at the right dose. \u2018This does not mean a script for every ill. We certainly cannot afford to waste NHS money [on what] can be bought over the counter.\u2019 Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018The vast majority of hard-pressed families have to pay for their own everyday essentials, and taxpayers will be furious if others are gaming the system. 'We must tighten up the rules on these giveaways and give GPs more flexibility, ensuring that only those who really need them receive them.\u2019 Critics have branded the prescriptions for regular bathroom cabinet items such as Vaseline, Calpol, suncream, toothpaste and multi-vitamins as 'ludicrous' at time of financial crisis for the NHS (file picture) The Mail analysed figures from the HSCIC\u2019s prescription cost analysis, an audit of all drugs handed out on the NHS by GPs, nurses and pharmacists. In England, most patients are charged a fee of \u00a38.20 for each prescription. But certain groups can get them for free, including the under-16s, the over-60s, pregnant women or new mothers and adults on benefits. Some patients eligible for free prescriptions have been swapping tips on how to get them for Calpol and Gaviscon on the MoneySavingExpert and Mumsnet websites. And in 2012, a GP from Glasgow, Scotland, described how patients were coming into his surgery with \u2018shopping lists\u2019 of items including nappy rash cream and moisturisers. Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association\u2019s GPs committee, said: \u2018GPs have a duty to prescribe where there is clinical need. \u2018What we don\u2019t want to see is anyone abusing the system. The whole prescribing system needs to be looked at.\u2019 The figures revealed that 1.1billion prescriptions were written in 2014 \u2013 more than 2,000 a minute and a rise of 3 per cent compared to the previous year.

Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. The researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart (shown above) Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. Scientists at Gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave. Their work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink, and also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain . Here are their main findings: . Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser:\u00a0This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull:\u00a0The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave:\u00a0This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world. Scientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft, for example. Professor Robert Ritchie, a materials scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was one of the co-authors of the research, said: 'Our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin\u2019s remarkable tear resistance. 'Collagen fibrils and fibers rotate, straighten, stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin. 'The movement of the collagen acts to effectively diminish stress concentrations associated with any hole, notch or tear.' To conduct the experiment the researchers used the skin taken from dead rabbits, carefully removed the hair and placed it in equipment designed to pull the skin apart. They then cut a small notch or hole in the skin and watched how it changed shape as the skin was stretched in a way intended to cause the tear to increase. However, rather than getting bigger as the skin tore, the notches simply yawned open. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, then used the x-ray beams produced by the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to study the structural changes that took place in the skin. They found the collagen in the dermis, the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin, changed its alignment at the edge of the tear. The collagen, which is normally in a disordered tangle, straightened and began to slide against each other to absorb the stress and provide extra strength. The researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle (shown left) to line up in straight parallel rows (shown right) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance . Dr Marc Meyers, a materials scientist at the University of California San Diego who also took part in the research, said: 'Straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase, and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation. 'This reorganization of the fibrils is responsible for blunting the stress at the tips of tears and notches.' Research on skin's mechanical properties dates back nearly 200 years, when physicians began examining stab wounds. The graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched (left) compared to bone (right) Unlike bone and teeth, which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress, the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress. The researchers behind the latest study are working with the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Professor Ritchie added: 'Natural inspiration is a powerful motivation to develop new synthetic materials with unique properties. 'For example, the mechanistic understanding we\u2019ve identified in skin could be applied to the improvement of artificial skin, or to the development of thin film polymers for applications such as flexible electronics.'",

As viewers watched, Joseph Kent held his hands up and walked in front of a phalanx of police Tuesday night after a citywide curfew had started. Seconds later, several officers in riot gear rushed out of their line and arrested him, just as a Humvee passed between the camera and the police, making social media churn with questions about what happened to Kent. Attorney Stephen Patrick Beatty confirmed he is representing Kent. He was still trying to get in touch with his client after Kent was released. \"He wanted me to tell people most that he doesn't want violence in his name,\" Beatty told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday night. The incident unfolded live on CNN about 40 minutes after the 10 p.m. curfew went into effect and as authorities tried to prevent the kind of rioting -- part of protests over the death of Freddie Gray -- that plagued the city Monday. Kent was being held on a charge of curfew violation, according to the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. People on Twitter continued to circulate the name of Kent, a young activist, making #JosephKent and #WhereIsJosephKent hot topics. Investigators made 10 arrests in Baltimore on Tuesday night, city Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said. Seven were for curfew violations, he said. Beatty said he met with Kent on Wednesday afternoon. \"He said he's physically OK, not injured. He's safe in there,\" Beatty said. But even though more than 100 people who had been held at the city's booking center were released earlier in the day, Kent was not one of them. Beatty initially checked on Kent's status, despite not officially representing him. He said Kent was just trying to help with getting people to go home when he was arrested. \"He went out there to try to settle things down because he had seen what happened in this city previously,\" Beatty said. \"And the last thing he wanted was any more violence, and he was trying to stop it.\" Kent once was employed as an intern, through an outside company, at Morgan State University's Entrepreneurial Development and Assistance Center, the school said Wednesday. But Kent is not a student there and, as far as the school can tell, never has been, MSU spokesman Clint Coleman said. A woman who answered the phone at the EDAC said that no one there was available to talk about Kent and that she'd have no further comment. In November, the Baltimore City Paper ran a story about Kent, then 21, and his participation in Baltimore protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict a police officer in the August shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. He helped lead protesters who walked through Morgan State's campus and eventually to City Hall on November 25, the newspaper reported. \"Everyone knows me at Morgan already, organizing and making sure everything (is) running the correct way and peaceful and everything like that,\" he said, according to the City Paper's article. \"So, everybody already knows I'm going to do things the right way, so when everybody else and community people and civilians and people who joined and saw that the Morgan students were looking up to it, before you knew it, the whole city was on my back and I was just carrying the whole city.\" Complete coverage on the Baltimore protests .

Mohamed Badie and 13 other defendants were handed their sentences as 37 people, including\u00a0an American-Egyptian citizen were jailed for life. The defendants found guilty of plotting unrest from their headquarters in a sprawling Cairo protest camp in the months after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. Scroll down for video . Upheld: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie, pictured at a trial earlier this year, has\u00a0had his death sentence confirmed by a Cairo judge . Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata, known for his harsh rulings in cases involving the Muslim Brotherhood, also sentenced two Islamists who have fled the country to death. Among those sentenced to life in prison is Mohamed Soltan, an American-Egyptian man who has been on a hunger strike over his detention for more than 14 months. Soltan's family called for Mohamed's immediate release in a statement after the verdict, charging that there was no evidence against him. His father Salah Soltan was among the 14 detainees sentenced to death. The U.S. embassy in Cairo said in a statement that it was 'gravely concerned' about Mohamed Soltan and would 'continue to monitor his case closely and to provide him with all possible support.' Sentenced: Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leader Badie (front) and his fellow defendants were found guilty of plotting unrest in the months after the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 . Ruling: Egyptian Judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata reads the verdicts in a cases in Cairo, on Saturday . The rulings can be appealed before the Court of Cassation, which has overturned dozens of other death sentences, including against Badie. So far Egypt has executed one Islamist sentenced to death after Morsi's overthrow, following his conviction of involvement in the murder of a youth during violent protests in July 2013. Judge Shehata read out a Koranic verse that stipulates amputation and crucifixion for outlaws, before rendering his verdict on Saturday. At a previous session, he had sought the opinion of the country's mufti, the Islamic legal authority who has an advisory role under Egyptian law, on the death sentences. Known as the 'Rabaa Operations Room' case, the prosecution accused the defendants of organising months of unrest and protests against the ouster of Morsi, a senior Brotherhood figure himself now on trial. The Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo was dispersed by police on August 14, 2013 in a 12-hour operation that left hundreds of protesters and about 10 policemen dead. Supporters of Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi stand their ground as Egyptian security forces move in to disperse them by force from the Rabaa al-Adawiya protest camp in Cairo in August 2013 . Mohamed Soltan was shot in the arm during the dispersal, and he was arrested days later as police hunted down Islamist activists who had fled the protest camp. Police moved in to disperse the camp after weeks of failed European and US-brokered negotiations with the Brotherhood, who publicly insisted on Morsi's return. The Islamist was the country's first freely elected president and he ruled only for a year before the army toppled him, spurred by massive protests demanding his resignation. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who toppled Morsi and then won an election, has pledged to eradicate the Brotherhood. The government has blacklisted the movement as a terrorist organisation amid a spike in militant attacks that have killed dozens of policemen and soldiers. The deadliest attacks have been claimed by jihadists in the Sinai Peninsula and in Cairo, and the Brotherhood insists it is committed to non-violence. But decapitated and driven underground, the Islamist movement is believed to have radicalised with members adopting militant tactics against policemen.",

You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn\u2019t see it like that at all. He\u2019s in it to win it. And it\u2019s in those little moments that the old Tiger \u2014 some would argue the real Tiger \u2014 breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn\u2019t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it . The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday . Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta . \u2018It would be my 15th major,\u2019 said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. \u2018Long way to go before that,\u2019 Woods replied. \u2018Lot of work to do.\u2019 He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade \u2014 14 years old \u2014 when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before \u2014 but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children, \u00a0Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice . Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice . As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world\u2019s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam \u2014 only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. \u2018He wasn\u2019t doing anything good,\u2019 he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second \u2014 maybe third, considering the events of 2009 \u2014 phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at\u00a0the Waste Management Phoenix Open . Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of\u00a0the Farmers Insurance Open . The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament . \u2018People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,\u2019 he said. \u2018I worked my ass off, that\u2019s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I\u2019d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. \u2018The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I\u2019d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I\u2019d lose it for an hour. Then I\u2019d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I\u2019d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand \u2014 and travelled some good distances. \u2018But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained.

And now he\u2019s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn\u2019t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn\u2019t help that the man in Woods\u2019s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street\u2019s Monday morning figures, and golf\u2019s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods\u2019s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That\u2019s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. \u2018I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn\u2019t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn\u2019t seize the opportunity.\u2019 The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing . Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond . The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. \u2018Winning,\u2019 deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. \u2018I like it,\u2019 he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now.",

Victoria Ayling, who is running for the key election seat of Great Grimsby, made the comments after being confronted by her local party over her non-attendance at Ukip meetings. After saying it was because she had spent \u2018five months nursing her son back to health after being blown up in Afghanistan\u2019, Lieutenant Colonel Ron Shepherd, the leader of Ukip\u2019s North East Lincolnshire group, launched an investigation.

It is the latest controversy to hit the 55-year-old, who in 2013 was caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: \u2018I just want to send the lot back.\u2019 She claimed her remarks had been taken \u2018out of context\u2019.

And now, Eurovision Song Contest legend Conchita Wurst has been given a dazzling high art makeover. The star has been transformed into Gustav Klimt's Golden Adele for the Life Ball 2015 poster. Scroll down for video . Conchita Wurst has been transformed into Gustav Klimt's Golden Adele for the Life Ball 2015 poster shot by Ellen von Unwerth . Conchita posed before industry heavyweight Ellen von Unwerth's lens for the poster, which will be on display on the streets of Vienna and cast in gold on a medallion by Austrian Mint. The poster promotes the dazzling Life Ball event, where Conchita will perform, as well as walk in a fashion show staged by Jean Paul Gaultier. Naturally, the 26-year-old wears a lavish gown in the imagery. The gold dress, which is embroidered with over 12,000 Swarovski crystals and 0.5kg of pearls and painted with 2.5kg of gold color, took over 1,000 hours to handcraft. Conchita posed before industry heavyweight Ellen von Unwerth's lens for the poster . Life Ball founder,\u00a0Gery Keszler, Conchita, legendary snapper Ellen and Jean Paul Gaultier pose on set . 'Being able to wear this art piece of a dress felt sensational,' gushed Conchita. 'I love Ellen! I knew a few of her works and was incredibly excited to meet her. What a great women.' Speaking about her work, Ellen Von Unworth said: 'I tried to imitate Klimt's painting - it almost felt flagrant. I love Klimt, his paintings with all those colors, all this glamor and and all the poetry. I felt very inspired by creating an homage to this extraordinary painting.' The Life Ball posters, which are created by world famous artists and convey the event's message, have become legendary since their launch in 2013. The poster will be auctioned off on the day of the Ball during the AIDS Solidarity Gala in the Hofburg palace for the benefit of Austrian and international HIV/AIDS projects. In 2014, the auction of the original photo by David La Chapelle sold for \u00a3130,000. Conchita, seen behind the scenes on set, won over the globe after winning Europe's biggest entertainment contest in 2014 . The Life Ball, which takes place in May, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV/AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball thanks to it's dazzling guestlist. Speaking about the origins of the glittering event, Keszler told FEMAIL: 'Life Ball was born out of the energy and environment prevalent across the world in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s - particularly in the fashion industry - that saw AIDS as a daily issue profoundly effecting our friends and colleagues who were dying, but that no one understood or was willing to talk about. 'There was this undercurrent of urgency to do something: to help, to get involved and make some noise. 'My main goal with the first Life Ball was to bring a spotlight to the disease, the fundraising aspect was a secondary consideration.' The Life Ball, pictured, is the biggest charity event in Europe supporting people with HIV or AIDS and is being dubbed Europe's answer to the MET Ball . Gery Keszler set up the event in 1992 with the goal of the show being to be provocative and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged. Right: Conchita as the star of this year's poster . Gery Keszler, left, pictured with Sir Elton John, centre, set up The Life Ball in 1992 to raise vital funds . The event, which has attracted the likes of Bill Clinton, left, and Dame Vivienne Westwood, aims to get people talking about AIDS, which Keszler says was a daily issue profoundly effecting his friends and colleagues who were dying but that no one understood or was willing to talk about . Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna, and combine the splendour of the Viennese Waltz with modern, liberal ideals\u00a0to celebrate life. 'At that time, the goal of the show was to be provocative as we were aiming to cause a stir and have HIV/AIDS and the taboo that it represented acknowledged,' he explained. 'When in 1993 one of my clients, Thierry Mugler\u2019s main stylist, died of the disease, he agreed to do the fashion show and so Life Ball as a standalone event was born. 'I had no conceivable idea what I was taking on, it was me and a fax machine in six square meters of office space in my client's kitchen. I funded it entirely from my own pocket and didn\u2019t really know if anyone was going to attend but knew that we had to do something.' Keszler aimed to marry the unique and prolific Ball tradition that they have in Vienna with more liberal ideas (Conchita Wurst pictured at the event) Prince Harry, who set up Sentebale, a charity that provides healthcare and education to vulnerable children in Lesotho, Southern Africa, will be honoured with an award for his services . As part of his Sentebale charity, Harry built the Mamohato Children's Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education and the initiative is being awarded . Keszler says this year's Life Ball, which takes place in Vienna, will 'undoubtedly be better than ever' Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and hopes to make as much noise about it as possible via his glittering event . From there, a huge event was born and the likes of Debbie Harry, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen were among the first guests. The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV/AIDS fundraisers in the world and has partnered with Elton John\u2019s AIDS Foundation, Bill Clinton\u2019s AIDS Initiative and AmFAR. Keszler says this year\u2019s Life Ball will 'undoubtedly be better than ever'. The event will be continuing its work with Elton John\u2019s foundation, supporting the crucial work that they do, and Graham Norton will be attending as part of the foundation. Adding some high fashion glamour to the event, Jean Paul Gaultier is set to unveil an exclusive retrospective of work twenty years after he first showed there. With gold as this year\u2019s Life Ball theme, taking inspiration from the exquisite baroque Vienna Secessionists, the couture show will follow the vibrant and ostentatious theme with a bevy of internationally acclaimed supermodels set to walk for well-connected Jean Paul. 'It is really perfect timing to have JPG back this year,' said Keszler. 'It has been twenty years since he was part of the Life Ball and we are at such an exciting time in our medical fight against HIV that his presence is a wonderful reminder of how far we have come.' The event is now listed as one of the top 50 HIV AIDS fundraisers in the world and has attracted guests such as Maria Cross, left, and Antonio Banderas and Naomi Campbell, right . Ricky Martin has performed at the event in previous years and 2015 will welcome Jean Paul Gaultier and Charlize Theron . Jean Paul's show will be watched from the front row by actress Charlize Theron, who will attend on behalf of her foundation Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project. Theron will join a bevy of A-list celebrities and performers, who pour into Vienna annually to help fight against HIV at the world\u2019s largest AIDS event. The Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project, based in her home country of South Africa, is dedicated to addressing HIV/AIDS in adolescents across sub-Saharan Africa through education, grant giving, networking and community outreach. Theron will give a keynote speech at the First Ladies Luncheon at the Belvedere Castle in Vienna ahead of attending the Life Ball, where she will present the work of her organisation and her vision for and AIDS-free generation. Prince Harry, who works tirelessly to help vulnerable children living in extreme poverty at risk of AIDS, will also be recognised. As part of his Sentebale charity, which he set up with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, the 30-year-old royal built the Mamohato Children\u2019s Centre to support vulnerable children through healthcare and education. And  Harry's programme will be receiving the 2015 Swarovski Crystal Of Hope Award at the glittering Life Ball event in May. Keszler won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change . Keszler 'strongly believes' that a cure for HIV is on the horizon and that the leap forward that was affordable generic medication was crucial to the fight for survival for the 34 million people in the world living with HIV. 'Ironically we have further to go in the fight against social AIDS than we do the medical disease now and thus it is this fight that we must be equally concerned with,' he said. But that's where the Life Ball comes in - and he won't stop until the event garners global recognition and thus increased power to effect change. He concludes: 'Life Ball is symbolic, it is a unique weekend in the year in which the world\u2019s most significant AIDS organisations come together, stand together, fight together and continue to fight for those who are not able to fight for themselves. 'It is my constant desire for Life Ball weekend to expand, to obtain more friends, have better connections, help more programmes and become internationally known for fighting social AIDS as well as the disease itself.'",

Two African-Americans -- Ella Jones and Wesley Bell -- were elected to the Ferguson City Council on Tuesday, meaning three of the six council members are black. [Previous story, published at 6:52 p.m. ET] . The skies grew ominous and the radio crackled with warnings of flash floods. Amid the rain, Ferguson opened its polls at 6 a.m. for municipal elections that traditionally have drawn very few out to vote. But today was different. This was the first city election since white police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager Michael Brown last August. Since then, this St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against African-Americans by law enforcement and the courts. There's widespread feeling, especially in the African-American community, that if the turnout is low, then all the protests, the investigations, the calls for change will have been in vain. St. Louis elections officials said they had no indication that turnout in Tuesday's election would be any different than other years. But among the candidates inspired to run by the events that transpired here, there was hope of seeing greater voter participation. \"That is what our democracy is about,\" said Wesley Bell, a 40-year-old lawyer and criminal justice professor who also is a part-time municipal judge in nearby Velda City. Bell is running against Lee Smith, a retired electrical plant employee, in Ward 3. That area includes Canfield Drive, where Brown was killed, and the West Florissant Avenue business corridor that felt the brunt of the protests and the vandalism. Charred, heavily damaged buildings stand as scars of Ferguson's despair and anger. Both Bell and Smith are black, And no matter the outcome, one of them will double the African-American representation on the council. Even though 70% of Ferguson's 21,000 people are black, five of the six current City Council members and the mayor are white. The council was cited along with the Ferguson Police Department, which has three black officers, as a symbol of white power in a majority black city. \"We have to get out of this law enforcement for business,\" said candidate Doyle McClellan, coordinator of the computer network security program at Lewis and Clark Community College. McClellan referred to the scathing report by the U.S. Department of Justice that found Ferguson issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city. \"That's not a good thing,\" McClellan said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station, hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided. The polls close here at 7 p.m. Results are not expected until a few hours later. Ted Heidemann, a 67-year-old retired airline pilot, said he voted for Brian Fletcher, a former mayor who launched the \"I Love Ferguson\" campaign last fall to raise money for mom and pop businesses that were hurt by the looting and vandalism. Some residents see Fletcher as being a part of the establishment, part of the problem. But Heidemann asked why no one complained when Fletcher was mayor. He said Brown's shooting brought a lot of bad things to light. \"We didn't realize the effect some of the institutional problems had on poor people,\" he said. \"Some things need to be changed and we are aware of that.\" By midafternoon, Fletcher said the numbers looked good. At a church where voters from all three wards were casting ballots, he predicted a 40-50% turnout. When the rain let up for a few minutes, a stream of voters trickled into the First Presbyterian Church in downtown Ferguson to cast their votes. Ellory and Kathy Glenn both voted for Bob Hudgins, a political novice who attracted attention as a white man who routinely stood with protesters on the front lines. He speaks often of having married a black woman and having a biracial teenage son. \"I wanted change,\" said Ellory Glenn, 60, who is black. His wife is white. He said the couple moved to Ferguson after he retired from the Marine Corps in 1995 because they felt it was a racially welcoming place. But now, after all the problems rose to the surface, it's time for fresh blood on the City Council, Glenn said. That's why they chose Hudgins over Fletcher. \"Quit using law enforcement as a revenue stream,\" he said. \"That's like using the military to go into places and looting them. The police are supposed to keep order.\" Angela Jackson came to the polls with her husband and two little girls in tow. She voted for Ella Jones, a former Mary Kay cosmetics sales director who resigned her job in January to run for office. Jackson echoed the thoughts of other Ferguson residents who experienced something new in this election: candidates coming to their door. Past elections have not seen the kind of canvassing activity that took place in the last few weeks. \"One thing we really liked is (Jones) came to our door and talked to us about her desire to make change in our neighborhood,\" Jackson said. \"She's going to be hands on. She lives in the neighborhood as well, and has for the past 36 years. We were kind of taken by that.\" Fletcher, the former mayor turned City Council candidate, campaigned that Ferguson would benefit from his experience more than a newcomer, saying his contacts from almost three decades in politics would be an invaluable asset in getting Ferguson back on its feet. \"I understand that feeling,\" Fletcher said of those who feel he's too entrenched in the city's old guard, \"but those individuals don't know me.\" The city is required to approve a new budget by the end of June and the new council will have to look for alternative sources of revenue to replace the $3 million or so lost from money generated by traffic tickets and fines. \"That amount will drop significantly,\" Fletcher said. The rain began to fall again as the Glenns got in their car. It was expected to continue off and on through the day and night. But about 5, just when many voters were leaving work, the sun shone brilliantly. Overheard at one precinct: Good weather brought out the worst in Ferguson last August. Maybe today, it would bring out the best.",

The election was seen as a potential catalyst for change in a city where institutional discrimination had been exposed.

On Tuesday Jessa Duggar announced she's pregnant with her first child with husband Ben Seewald, 19. 'We're expecting!' the 22-year-old 19 Kids & Counting star told People. 'We are so excited. The due date is November first, our wedding anniversary.' Scroll down for video . A baby on the way:\u00a0Jessa Duggar announced she's expecting her first child with Ben Seewald, 19. 'We're expecting!' the 22-year-old 19 Kids & Counting star announced on Tuesday . Excited for the arrival: The TLC stars also shared this image that had written on a white onesie, 'Coming soon, 11.01.2015' Something in the water! Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar (middle) shared an image of Jessa (right) showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill (far left), who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken . A big hint:\u00a0The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting -\u00a0Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share they're planning for a little one . Jessa's baby will be the sixth grandchild for the Duggars. She is the third child to marry, and every marriage has resulted in a baby the first year of marriage. The youngest of Jim Bob and Michelle's children, Josie, seen here in Jim Bob's lap, is younger than their eldest granddaughter Mackynzie, who is seated in the front row . Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar shared an image of Jessa showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill, who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken. 'Congrats @JessaSeewald @BenSeewald on your pregnancy! It was great to be pregnant together @jillmdillard,' she wrote in the caption. Anna, who is married to eldest Duggar Josh, is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, a baby girl due in July. The couple, who married in 2008 after a chaste courtship, already have Mackynzie, Michael and Marcus. Josh works for the Family Research Council, a pro life, anti gay marriage Christian lobbying organization in Washington DC. The whole family is famously prolife and shuns birth control. Michelle stopped taking birth control after she miscarried early in her marriage. She had gone on the pill following eldest child Josh's birth. Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. Michelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again. Now Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show. And lots of kids isn't all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. Josh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sister . The whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year. Josh now works for the Family Research Council, a conservative prolife group . Josh shared this photo of his wife and younger brother Joseph for Joseph's birthday - wearing anti Roe v Wade t-shirts for the occasion . Jill, the fourth eldest Duggar, welcomed son Israel David earlier this month, ten months after her wedding. And now the fertility streak is continuing with daughter Jessa and her husband Ben. 'We are looking forward to being parents,' Ben told People on Tuesday. 'I am feeling pretty good,' added Jessa. 'The morning sickness was different every day. It's getting better, but I'm still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don't have any super serious food cravings.' The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting. Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they're planning for a little one. The picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa's stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy. Anna, left, got to be pregnant with Jill, right, for this her fourth pregnancy. The pair posed for this photo earlier this year, before Jessa's pregnancy was public . Flashback! For her first pregnancy, Anna and her mother-in-law Michelle were pregnant at the same time . Making babies! They shared their passion online and the lovebirds in a romantic kiss after they married. They saved the first kiss for their wedding day and only held hands when they got engaged . Hiding her tummy: On Sunday the Duggar daughter shared this image to Instagram with the caption, 'Headed to Big Sandy, TX to meet up with my family!' The two did not make any kind of statement at the time. In her People interview, the TLC star explained that she found out she was with child when she took a pregnancy test one Sunday morning before church. 'I said, \"Hey Ben, guess what? Yeah, you're a dad.\" We couldn't believe it,' the daughter of Jim Bob, 49, and Michelle Duggar, 48. She added, 'We are so excited. We have started talking baby names. It is one of those things that is so special, picking a name for a baby.' It runs in the family: Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor . Ben works for Jim Bob Duggar doing odd jobs, and Jessa was always chief organizer for her younger siblings, organizing their home school and packing for trips. No doubt reality tv paychecks and assorted book and speaking fees will help the young couple afford the new addition. And both will have time to raise the little one. The Seewalds live in a house on the Duggar property, owned by Jim Bob and Michelle. Previously Josh and Anna lived their, and welcomed their two older children into the world in home births in the house. Mackynzie was born int he master bedroom, and Michael was born while Anna was on the toilet. Marcus was born at a midwifery center. It's not known if Jessa plans to homebirth in the same house as Anna or not. Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor and an emergency c-section. They had planned a homebirth as well, as Jill is a midwife, but it didn't go as planned. Jill says the doctor stitched her up really well, however, and she hopes to have many more pregnancies and deliver future children vaginally. On Tuesday evening during an episode of 19 Kids & Counting Jessa and Ben will feature a special message. Also in the episode a look at the couple's honeymoon in Venice and Paris is shared. The two are seen kissing in Piazza San Marco as pigeons land on their heads. The honeymoon!\u00a0On Tuesday evening during an episode of 19 Kids & Counting, Jessa and Ben are seen visiting Venice, Italy where they kiss in Piazza San Marco as pigeons land on their heads . Yikes: The reality star was a put startled when a pigeon landed on her and said, 'When they see food they attack you' He was impressed: While in the square Ben said,\u00a0'The city itself is tight and close together, but here is this big open square' Just like an old married couple: The TLC standouts talked about getting close with the birds; Jessa said she didn't like having their claws in her hair. THey also went to Paris on their honeymoon . Being pregnant has not changed Jessa and Ben's plans to adopt. 'Our hearts haven't changed on adoption,' the star said. People noted the agency the couple has contacted 'requires prospective parents to be married for two years before adopting.' 'We are still making plans,' she said. For now the two are just soaking it all in. 'We are trying to take it one day at a time,' Ben said. Their wedding made for good ratings: The Arkansas residents tied the knot on November 1, 2014 in front of 1,000 people and the nuptials were aired on TLC . 'We pray every night that God helps us be good parents. We are getting advice from other parents.' And though Jessa is only 22, she has a good perspective on how things should move forward. 'I am not comparing, not worrying about what could happen, we are just getting prepared,' the TLC favorite said. 'I think having this first year together to share our lives, just the two of us, has been special. We are definitely excited to be parents.'

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nHillary Clinton shaped State Department policy to reward big money foreign donors to her family foundation, an explosive new book written by a political foe will claim. According to author Peter Schweizer there is a clear trend of money flowing into the controversial Clinton Foundation and rewards emerging for donors - in forms such as free trade agreements and development projects. The claims against Clinton, Secretary of State from 2009-13, are laid out in Clinton Cash, due to be published May 5th by HarperCollins. Bombshell: Clinton Cash, right, a new book by Peter Schweizer, is set to spell out a trend whereby big money donors to the Clinton Foundation found U.S. policies coming out of the State Department shift in their favor . Introducing the book, former George W Bush speechwriter said: 'We will see a pattern of financial transactions involving the Clintons that occurred contemporaneous with favorable U.S. policy decisions benefiting those providing the funds'. The passage, and examples of the donations and decisions Schweizer analyzes, were published Sunday by the New York Times, which was given an advance copy of the book. The Times reported that Clinton Cash lists examples of the pattern including a free trade agreement in Colombia that benefited a donor with industrial interests there. It also cites development projects in Haiti after their devastating 2010 earthquake, and a $1million payment to Bill Clinton made by a Canadian shareholder in the Keystone XL oil pipeline while it was being discussed by State Department officials. Author: Peter Schweizer, pictured, researched donations made to Clinton's foundation and was noted by the Times for 'meticulously' documenting his sources . As well as contending that the Clintons favored donors to swell the coffers of the foundation, Schweizer also writes that some of the big-money deals 'put millions in their own pockets'. Marketing information from HaperCollins includes more claims, citing 'the Clinton\u2019s [sic] troubling dealings in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Haiti, and other places at the \"wild west\" fringe of the global economy.' It continued that the book will see Schweizer raise 'serious questions of judgment, of possible indebtedness to an array of foreign interests, and ultimately, of fitness for high public office.' The White House declined on Monday to categorically rule out the occurrence of any wrongdoing but said there's no 'tangible evidence to indicate that it did.' 'I'm not gonna be in a position here, where every time somebody raises a spurious claim...to sit down here and say that it's not true,' President Barack Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. Earnest directed reporters who had further questions to Clinton's presidential campaign. Clinton allies have characterized the book as simply the latest in a series of 'absurd conspiracy theories' designed to derail Clinton's 2016 campaign. According to the Times, Republican senators - including presidential candidates Rand Paul and Marco Rubio - have been briefed on the book's findings, and are working them into their campaigns. Paul in particular has been unstinting in his criticism of Clinton, positioning himself as an anti-Hillary candidate before she even announced she was running. No more, please: In light of her presidential bid, the Clinton Foundation has stopped accepting donations from most governments - notably Saudi Arabia. Pictured above is Clinton while Secretary of State standing with her counterparts from Saudi Arabia (right) and Kuwait (left) The Kentucky senator's Twitter feed Sunday night included several references to foreign Clinton donations - and his official website includes a whistle-blowing form\u00a0where members of the public can forward 'additional information' to Paul's campaign. In light of repeated attacks on the activities of the Clinton Foundation - which is named after Bill, Hillary and their daughter Chelsea - it recently\u00a0stopped accepting money\u00a0from all but six foreign governments. Clinton also resigned from the foundation's board when she announced her presidential bid. After the moves, a spokesman said: 'By implementing this new, even stronger and more transparent policy, the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world'.",

The book claims to identify a pattern of favorable policy shifts, such as free trade agreements and development projects, coinciding with donations from foreign entities to the foundation. Schweizer also suggests that some of these dealings financially benefited the Clintons personally. \n\nWhile the White House has not found tangible evidence of wrongdoing, Clinton's political opponents, including Republican presidential candidates, are seizing on the book's allegations. The Clinton Foundation, in response to criticism, has stopped accepting donations from most foreign governments and Hillary Clinton has resigned from its board since announcing her presidential candidacy.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nYou might know that H20 is the chemical formula for water, but what about the chemistry of you? Dr Joe Hanson, a science writer and biologist based in Austin, Texas, pondered this very question and now has calculated what the human body is in terms of chemical elements. He revealed that a 'human molecule' might contain 375 million atoms of hydrogen, 132 million atoms of oxygen and 85 million atoms of carbon. By comparison, this human molecule contains just one atom of cobalt and three molecules of the metal molybdenum. When written out in full, the human molecule would read: Co1 Mo3 Se4 Cr7 F13 Mn13 I14 Cu76 Zn2,110 Fe2,680 Si38,600 Mg40,000 Cl127,000 K177,000 Na183,000 S206,000 P1,020,000 Ca1,500,000 N6,430,000 C85,700,000 O132,000,000 H375,000,000. The full list of elements that Dr Hanson says would be found in a human molecule if such a thing existed - each set of letters represent a chemical element and the numbers are the proporation of atoms in each 'molecule' Dr Hanson claims his formula, however, only represents the chemical make up of the human body at birth. Life on Earth may have been kickstarted by a series of chemical reactions triggered by two simple but poisonous compounds that were plentiful on our planet four billion years ago. Chemists have found it is possible to create the three main molecular building blocks of life - DNA, proteins and lipids - from hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen sulphide and ultraviolet light. Their findings suggest that the basic components for biological cells could have all occurred simultaneously in primordial ponds and streams, coming together to form the first cells. This suggests that life may well have first emerged here on Earth - out of a toxic soup of poisonous gas - rather than being carried to our planet by a comet or meteorite from outer space. But the researchers behind the new study say that meteorite impacts probably still played a key role in giving life a first leg up on the ladder towards existence. They claim that meteorite impacts around four billion years ago - known as the Late Heavy Bombardment - could have carried with them carbon rich material that reacted with nitrogen in the air to produce an abundance of hydrogen cyanide. This poisonous gas could then have dissolved in water and undergone a series of chemical reactions, along with hydrogen sulphide, driven by ultraviolet light. Over our lifetimes the proportions of these elements change as age and we pick up traces of other elements like heavy metals and gold. Dr Hanson said: 'Out of 98 naturally occurring elements, just over 30 are known to be essential to some form of life on Earth. 'In ancient times scholars believed everything in the universe was made from just four elements - earth, water, fire and air. 'Today we know it is a little more complicated than that. Living things are made up of cells, cells are made up of molecules and molecules are made up of atoms. 'But that old idea turns out to be sort of right. 'Altogether, 97% of the mass all living matter is made of just four chemical elements.' Dr Hanson, who created the video for the It's Okay to be Smart PBS channel on YouTube, also calculated that the average human body has the equivalent of 16kg (35lbs) of carbon in it and enough oxygen to fill a volume equivalent to 6 elephants. He said the human body also contained enough hydrogen to fill the volume of a blue whale and the same amount of nitrogen as is found in 400 litres of urine. But the human body may also be a source of revenue for those who think it is worth the effort. If the average person was to cut off all their tails and toenails, they could extract a nugget of gold worth around a tenth of a US cent (one sixteenth of a penny), according to Dr Hanson. He said: 'The average adult contains detectable amounts of 60 elements, mostly just traces of our diet and environment that have built up over time. If you isolated all of the elements in your body into their pure form, the ingredients for one life would fetch around one to two thousands dollars on the open market. 'Of course you can't really do that, but it gives us another way to look at life.' Biologist Dr Joe Hanson has worked out what the human body would look like as a chemical formula (above) The average adult human body contains around 16kg (35lbs) of carbon. Pictured is a lump of carbon-rich coal .",
    "text": "Dr. Joe Hanson, a biologist, created a \"human molecule\" formula to represent the proportion of chemical elements in the human body at birth. This formula, consisting of 30 essential elements, highlights the predominance of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. While 97% of our body mass comes from just four elements (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen), trace amounts of other elements are acquired throughout our lives. Interestingly, an average person's body contains enough valuable elements like gold to be technically \"worth\" a small amount of money. Dr. Hanson emphasizes that this formula is a simplified representation and the proportions of elements change as we age and interact with our environment.",

He was eventually arrested in November in a cafe after posing outside five different police stations over two weeks and was this week jailed for eight months. Aaron Bee went on the run for two weeks last year, taunting the police officers who were chasing him with selfies taken outside their headquarters. He has now been jailed for eight months . But after spending less than five months behind bars since his arrest, the 22-year-old has already been released. Last year Bee taunted officers by captioning photographs 'come catch me if you can' and bragging that he was 'always playing hide and seek'. He visited five different police stations without being apprehended and even flashing his genitals outside one. The father of one had been wanted by police for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend after showing up at her house in the middle of the night. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he had been 'threatening and abusive' towards the woman when he 'kicked her door down' last October. The father of one pictured outside Lincolnshire Police headquarters in November. He was eventually arrested in a cafe . Before his arrest Bee said he was taunting police 'as a bit of fun'. He was jailed yesterday for eight months but has been released after spending less than five months behind bars since being arrested . When police couldn't find him after the assault they released his mugshot to appeal for his whereabouts. In response, Bee took to Facebook to mock their efforts. Among pictures he shared online was one of a police officer standing in the street which he captioned 'is it me you're looking for'. He also posed outside Lincolnshire Police HQ, looking towards the camera and giving a thumbs up. In other posts he said the justice system 'is really f****d up' and bragged about buying a doughnut in Tesco without being caught. At the time, he said he was taunting police 'because it's funny.' He told reporters: 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me,' without disclosing his whereabouts. The 22-year-old made several jibes on Facebook, joking that he needed new hiding places after being hunted for breaking a non-molestation order against his former girlfriend . While on the run Bee mocked police officers by uploading a photograph of one with the caption 'hello is it me your (sic) looking for'. He was arrested in mid November and remanded into custody . Before his arrest Bee bemoaned being hunted by police for 'a poxy assaut'. Lincoln Crown Court heard how he grabbed his former girlfriend by the throat when he broke a non-molestation order to turn up at her house . He was eventually arrested in a cafe in Lincoln before being brought before court. Sentencing, Judge Michael Heath said: 'The non-molestation order was made in April 2013 by a County Court judge. 'He did not make it for fun. He made it to afford protection to the person who applied for it who was your erstwhile partner. 'When a judge makes a non-molestation order he expects that it will be obeyed. 'If it isn't you go inside. If you breach the non-molestation order again the sentences will get longer and longer.' Bee was jailed for eight months but is likely to be released imminently after being kept behind bars since November.",

Web users and conservationists quickly criticised her indifference towards animal welfare after it emerged the accessory was made from the feathers of no less than 80 of the colourful birds, according to the\u00a0People's Daily Online. Outcry: Opera singer Liu Guijuan is heavily criticised for showing off her headdress (pictured) made with feather from 80 kingfishers . Peking opera singer Liu Guijuan wrote in her post on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, that she had bought the rare headpiece more than a decade ago for 120,000 yuan (\u00a310,775). 'It is made with the feathers from under the wings of 80 kingfishers,' she said the post. Miss Liu, a well-respected opera artist from Tianjin city, said the current market price for the headdress is no less than 400,000 yuan (\u00a342,583). She added that she is often envied by fellow artists at the backstage for wearing such pieces. The post immediately attracted attention of Chinese animal lovers, who said art shouldn't come at the cost of sacrificing innocent birds. 'I feel like these people should step down. Who wants to see you if you build your art upon animal's suffering. We would rather you get out!' Commented one web user. In the name of art: Miss Liu, an established opera singer in China, is seen on stage (right) in the headdress that landed her in hot water . But there were some supportive voices too. 'Liu Guijuan has followed industry rule and the headdresses are just for performing purpose, it has nothing to do with environmental protection,' wrote one unnamed web user. Others suggested that artists could just as easily use fake feathers to create realistic costumes. Victim: Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species . Faced with public outcry, Miss Liu initially didn't back down. She replied in her comments: 'I'm doing this in respect to art. In order to buy the best (headdress), I'd rather spend more money and use more kingfishers.' She also indicated that Chinese Peking opera master, Mei Lanfang, used to collect headpieces with feathers from  kingfishers. However, she took down her original post not long after. Two of the 11 types of kingfisher in China are protected species. People's Daily Online reported in the same article that the police authority in Guangdong seized nearly 60,000 dead kingfishers last October.

Researchers found coffee can stop the growth of tumours in women who have already been treated with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is the main hormonal therapy drug given to women who have not been through the menopause, and is usually taken for five years or longer after treatment for breast cancer. Just two cups of coffee a day can halve the risk of breast cancer returning and boosts the effect of the drug tamoxifen, researchers found . Most breast cancer tumours rely on the hormone oestrogen to grow, and tamoxifen blocks oestrogen from reaching the cancer cells. This means the cancer either grows more slowly or stops growing altogether. As part of the study, Swedish and British researchers looked at data from 1,090 breast cancer patients, in a follow up of a similar study carried out two years ago. They found that more than 500 women who had been treated with tamoxifen, and those that had drunk at least two cups of coffee a day, had only half the risk of their cancer returning than those who drank less coffee, or none at all. Ann Rosendahl, a researcher from Lund University who carried out the study, said: 'The study also shows that those who drank at least two cups of coffee a day had smaller tumours and a lower proportion of hormone-dependent tumours. 'We saw that this was already the case at the time of diagnosis.' Researchers also looked more closely at two substances that usually occur in coffee \u2013 caffeine and caffeic acid. They found the breast cancer cells reacted to these substances, especially caffeine. Caffeine caused the cells to divide less frequency, and die more often, especially when it was drunk in combination with tamoxifen. The study found  caffeine caused breast cancer cells to divide less frequently and die more often . Ms Rosendahl said: 'This shows that these substances have an effect on the breast cancer cells and turn off signalling pathways that the cancer cells require to grow.' The team demonstrated both in in breast cancer patients and at cell level that coffee can reinforce the effect of treatment with tamoxifen. However, they emphasise the importance of taking prescribed medication. Ms Rosenhal added: 'They are incredibly important, but if you like coffee and are also taking tamoxifen, there is no reason to stop drinking it. 'Just two cups a day is sufficient to make a difference.' This is not the first study to link coffee consumption with improved cancer prognosis. Drinking coffee may reduce the risk of cancer in heavy drinkers, research has found. A World Cancer Research Fund study shows the hot drink can protect against liver cancer, which is often associated with alcohol abuse. For each cup consumed a day, there is about a 14 per cent decreased risk of liver cancer, found the study by the World Cancer Research Fund. And scientists at Harvard Medical School have found that women who drink three or more cups of coffee a day have a 20 per cent lower risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer compared to those who had less than one cup per month. They also found that men who drank the same amount saw a nine per cent lower risk of the skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma.",
    "text": "A study has found that drinking two cups of coffee daily can significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence in women who have been treated for the disease, particularly when combined with the drug tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a hormonal therapy commonly prescribed to pre-menopausal women for at least five years following breast cancer treatment. The research, involving 1,090 breast cancer patients, showed that women consuming at least two cups of coffee daily had a 50% lower risk of cancer returning compared to those who drank less or no coffee. The study also found that caffeine and caffeic acid in coffee affect breast cancer cells by reducing their division and increasing cell death, enhancing tamoxifen's effectiveness. While emphasizing the importance of prescribed medication, researchers suggest that coffee can be a beneficial addition for patients taking tamoxifen. This study aligns with previous research linking coffee consumption to a reduced risk of various cancers, including liver and skin cancers.",

Nick Cousins, 57, and Grace Garcia Cousins, 53, were held over alleged 'ill treatment' of their child after it emerged that her birth, and that of her 14-year-old sister, were never registered and they did not attend school. The couple were also being questioned by police over claims that Filipino Mrs Cousins had overstayed her visa. The 15-year-old daughter of Briton Nick Cousins (left) and his partner Grace (right) fell to her death\u00a0from their multi-million pound flat in Hong Kong . Police said the girl, Blanca Cousins (right) had been unhappy and a police source said she locked herself in a bathroom before falling to her death as her parents tried to unlock the door . Police sources say Blanca (pictured) was watching television in the apartment's master bedroom while her parents watched TV in the living room shortly before the tragedy . A police spokeswoman said a security guard found Blanca lying on the ground at the foot of the apartment block shortly after 1.46am . Tragedy: Blanca fell to her death in an apparent suicide early on Tuesday morning after locking herself in a bathroom of the apartment in Hong Kong's exclusive 3 Repulse Bay Road (pictured) Mr Cousins, originally from Thurrock, Essex, is managing director of the Hong Kong arm of international insurance broking firm Jardine Lloyd Thompson, and has worked for the firm in Asia for more than 20 years. There were claims last night that Mrs Cousins had originally moved to Hong Kong from the Philippines in the 1990s and worked as a domestic helper before becoming the partner of Mr Cousins. It is unclear whether they had married, although she uses his surname. It is believed the couple had been watching television in the family's home on the 21st floor of one of Hong Kong's most luxurious apartment buildings before Blanca's mother found her daughter was locked in a bathroom shortly before 2am. Blanca fell to her death from a window just before dawn. Paramedics declared her dead at the foot of the building in Repulse Bay. Police sources claimed while no suicide note had been found they were aware the girl had been 'unhappy' in recent weeks. The girl's father has been named as Nick Cousins (pictured)\u00a0the managing director of insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson's Hong Kong office . Blanca \u2013 who was known as Blancs \u2013 was due to celebrate her 16th birthday in July. She was a member of the Hong Kong Pony Club and was understood to have been educated at a private tuition centre along with her younger sister. School attendance is mandatory in Hong Kong, but a more relaxed approach is taken with expatriate residents and some 'home school' their children without official permission. However, not having their births registered meant the girls would not have been able to get either compulsory identity cards or passports to pass through the territory's strictly controlled borders, which suggests they spent their entire lives in Hong Kong. Last night, one expat who knows Mr Cousins described the family as 'down to earth and decent'. He added: 'He isn't a Hooray Henry at all, like so many of the expats in top jobs in Hong Kong. He's more of an Essex-boy type who worked his way up the corporate ladder and is just very bright and very good at what he does.' Both of the Cousins girls appeared to have a wide circle of friends among the city's well-to-do expatriate community. Carla Cousins \u2013 Blanca's younger sister \u2013 recently posted pictures on Facebook revealing that her father had a company box at last month's Hong Kong Sevens rugby tournament and invited friends to join her at the event. The 21-storey apartment block is one of the city's most prestigious addresses, with four-bedroom apartments selling for \u00a37.5million each while they rent for \u00a38,000 a month. The 21-storey apartment is one of the wealthy city's most prestigious addresses with luxury four-bedroom apartments selling for prices in the region of \u00a37.5million . A police source last night said: 'Initial investigations showed there were no suspicious circumstances and [Blanca] was suspected to have fallen from a height. 'We arrested a 53-year-old Filipino female for overstaying and a 58-year-old British male for aiding and abetting an overstayer. 'Both have also been arrested for suspected ill treatment of the girl. Our investigations indicate the girl was unhappy with her life.' Last night a spokesman for the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group said: 'We can confirm that our colleague Nick Cousins, the managing director of our Hong Kong office, has suffered the loss of his eldest daughter in tragic circumstances. We are giving Nick our full support through this difficult time and he will be on compassionate leave until further notice. 'We are aware that the authorities are investigating a number of matters that have come to light in the wake of this tragic event. As these are private matters, it would not be appropriate for us to comment further. 'Our thoughts are with Nick and his family.'

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nIf Manuel Pellegrini leaves the Barclays Premier League at the end of this season \u2014 and it is by no means certain \u2014 then he will leave behind barely a trace. Inside Manchester City, the Chilean has always provided a welcome contrast to the emotional stresses of life epitomised by his predecessor Roberto Mancini but \u2014 on the field and across the landscape of English football \u2014 Pellegrini has made the shallowest of footprints. Progress at the Etihad Stadium has in recent years been slight. Indeed, you could say there has been none, particularly in relation to money spent. At City, however, the fact is that the identity of the manager represents only a small part of the problem. Manuel Pellegrini could be out of a job in the summer, and if he is, he will have left little behind . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has fallen well short of the standards he set in recent seasons . Pellegrini leaves the stadium as Manchester City suffered their fifth defeat in seven matches . As reported in Sportsmail after City\u2019s defeat in Barcelona last month, there is no particular desire at the club to sack Pellegrini. More poor results, more points separating his team from champions-elect Chelsea may cause the ground to shift a little further but any decision regarding the manager will be motivated much more by what happens next rather than what happened over the past eight months. Certainly, this has been a lamentable defence of the title, as bad as when conceding it by 11 points in 2013. At the Etihad there is, however, a recognition that problems are not all down to the manager. There are some issues with Pellegrini. Some City players think he is too nice \u2014 a soft touch who does not inspire with words or his substitutions and who displays a fondness for a 4-4-2 formation that they feel leaves them vulnerable. Pellegrini has not alienated or even polarised his dressing room, however. The majority are happy to work and play for him. The more significant problem is that City\u2019s squad, constructed carefully and expensively, is too old, too foreign and has not been improved by recent transfers. James Milner is one of very few Englishmen in a first team squad that is too foreign and too old . Manchester City signed defender Eliaquim Mangala for \u00a332million last summer and he has been poor . Wilfried Bony was signed in January from Swansea for \u00a328m but has only scored once since arriving . City have had a very good team for quite a while now. Signing David Silva and Yaya Toure in 2010 and Sergio Aguero a year later lifted them to their current level but nothing since the first Premier League title has hinted at the further progress many presumed would be inevitable. Recruitment has, on the whole, been poor, thus allowing established players to coast, perhaps subconsciously, without the pressure of in-house competition. Football director Txiki Begiristain has been largely responsible for this and his contribution, at least that which we can see, has been disappointing given the reputation earned at Barcelona. At all clubs, teams and players must move forward to thrive but too many at City have stagnated. Vincent Kompany, for example, no longer seems capable of looking after his own performances, never mind that of his team. For a club captain, his popularity in the City dressing room is limited. Elsewhere, players such as Samir Nasri contributed when City were playing well but disappeared once things became harder. Since hacking at Neymar during the Barcelona defeat, an act that earned him the cheapest of yellow cards, the France international has played only 13 minutes of two games. It is understood that the two things are not unrelated. Nasri is just one who may fret a little about his future this summer. Txiki Begiristain (left) has failed to live up to his reputation, and Manchester City's recruitment has been poor . Stevan Jovetic, a \u00a322m signing from Fiorentina, could find himself shipped out as City try to deal with FFP . Samir Nasri gives a thumbs up despite City's defeat at Crystal Palace, and the Frenchman's poor form . Wary of Financial Fair Play restrictions, City cannot spend enormous sums on targets such as Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba without first selling. Others who are vulnerable include Stevan Jovetic, Bacary Sagna and even Toure. The Toure debate is not new but what should be kept in mind is that the Ivorian will not be going anywhere until someone matches a salary that exceeds \u00a31million a month. It could be that City\u2019s climb back to the very top will be slow. They will need to be shrewder in the market and hope investment in their academy pays off. Better decisions are required from top to bottom. As for Pellegrini, he would be daft to think he is not vulnerable and a late-season surge would help him. Odd as it sounds, however, the identity of the manager is currently not City\u2019s biggest issue.",

Undersheriff Tim Albin, of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer Robert Bates, 73. Bates, who was a volunteer deputy, shot dead Eric Harris, 44, after he was tackled to the ground. Video of the killing shows Bates exclaiming that he opened fired by accident, and apologizing. Resignation: Undersheriff Tim Albin (pictured), of the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Oklahoma, quit his job Monday after new revelations about how the department treated elderly killer, reserve deputy Robert Bates . In the tide of scrutiny which followed the incident, it emerged that other deputies in the department had expressed concern about his fitness to serve, but were told to hold their tongues. Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had made substantial donations to the department in previous years. He has been charged with manslaughter - but a judge allowed him to take a month-long holiday to the Bahamas before his day in court. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify why Undersheriff Tim Albin stepped down, but said departmental reorganization was necessary following the April 2 shooting. Charged: Bates, 73, (left) accidentally grabbed his pistol and killed Eric Harris (right, in a previous mug shot) in what he said was an accident . 'Given the gravity of the current situation and the need to go a different direction with our leadership and management he agrees with me that it is time for a change,' Glanz wrote in a news release. Albin, who has been in his position for 26 years, has yet to comment on his departure, which will take effect and the end of this week. Albin was named in a 2009 internal investigation released Friday that showed deputies had expressed concerns about Bates' performance. Some claimed Albin gave Bates preferential treatment and intimidated those who raised concerns. The former head of the reserve deputy program, Sergeant Randy Chapman, told the investigator that Albin chastised him after he questioned Bates' performance. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . 'You need to stop messing with (Bates) because he does a lot of good for the County,' Chapman is quoted in the memo saying Albin told him that. Chapman declined to talk about the memo when contacted last week by The Associated Press and also declined Monday after Albin's resignation. 'I've been told to stay out of it,' he said. According to the report, Chapman complained to Albin on one occasion that Bates was driving a personal car with police equipment prior to having the requisite training, Albin told him: 'This is a s--- sandwich and you will just have to eat it but not acquire a taste for it.' A little more than five years later, 44-year-old Eric Harris was shot while on the ground in custody after running from deputies following a sting operation. The 73-year-old Bates has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree manslaughter. Bates is white and Harris was black, but the victim's brother has said he doesn't believe the shooting was racially motivated. Attorneys for Harris' family have repeatedly called on Glanz and Albin to resign.",

Sportsmail held an exclusive Q&A with the\u00a0forward\u00a0after he found out about the accolade. Harry Panayiotou has scooped the Barclays Premier League U21 Player of the Month award for March . Congratulations, Harry. How would you describe your style of play at Leicester? Hold up play, roll the defender. And I've got a good burst of acceleration! Who do you look up to in the first team? Jeff (Schlupp). I grew up with Jeff so to see him come through the youth ranks, he's definitely my role model. Do you train with them often? I do, but not as much as I'd like to. Your record at Leicester reads one game, one goal. How did that come about? I was a first year and I scored 20 goals that season. They had nothing to play for [against Leeds] so they chucked me up there, and I came on and scored! How often do you speak to Nigel Pearson? Not too much this season, he's a busy guy! But when he has a chance to come talk to me, he comes and talks to me. Is your goal to make it at Leicester next season, or go out on loan? I'm Leicester born and bred and my goal is to make the first team, that's all I've ever wanted to do, it's not about going anywhere else to me. I'd love for us to stay in the Premier League, and I believe I can handle it. Panayiotou hopes to make Leicester City's first team in the Premier League and has grown up nearby . How do you relax away from football? Chill with my friends, I'm around some really good people. On to that international hat-trick... how did you get to play for St Kitts? My mum and grandma are from St Kitts, and my grandma passed away when I was younger - so making the choice to play for them came from the heart. What was the reaction when you came back? Everyone's jealous when I go away (laughs), but they were still really happy. U21 manager Steve [Beaglehole] couldn't stop looking at me for a week! Where did you play, and what was it like? Turks and Caicos. It was really hot! \u00a0When you go to the Caribbean, you either have to train at 7am or at night time. The players in the Caribbean are much stronger and really quick, so you have to think quick - that's all it is. Some of them aren't the best players but they have certainly got a lot of strength so you've got to adapt to that. Any St Kitts players you would tip to make it? Romaine Sawyers from Walsall, he's technically brilliant. I think he'll get a move this summer because he's really good. And our captain is doing great with FC Dallas in the MLS right now, Atiba Harris. There's a few others from England, who could definitely be higher up but they just haven't been seen. Panayiotou posted this picture on Twitter with the caption 'motherland' while he was away on international duty . Last album you listened to? I went to the Nicki Minaj concert the other day [in Nottingham[ so has to be The Pink Print . Last film? Fast and furious 7... emotional to be fair. Last holiday (apart from your international break!)? Egypt . A player you would tip to make it at Leicester? Ben Chilwell (England U19 international) Best advice you've received from a first team player? I remember Andy King once speaking to me. He said when you come and make an impression, don't worry about what anyone has to say and just make sure you're seen. Keep working hard, going to the gym, keep practicing. Best player you've ever played against? Sammy Ameobi, he's got great feet, we played him a tournament a couple of years ago. For how tall he is it's actually amazing, and his finishing is on point! What would you be doing if you weren't a footballer? I've always seen myself as a footballer. Nothing else. Maybe I'd be in the Caribbean, it's just peaceful. The striker battles with Everton's Ryan Ledson during an Under 21 Premier League game in January .

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nTim Sherwood said his Aston Villa team \u2018bamboozled\u2019 Liverpool and paid particular tribute to Christian Benteke, Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish, the teenager who shone on his Wembley debut. Villa earned a comeback win to book their place in the FA Cup final against Arsenal and end Steven Gerrard\u2019s dream of lifting the famous old trophy on his birthday before bidding farewell to the club. Sherwood was dealt a blow by Gabby Agbonlahor\u2019s failure to overcome a hamstring injury, but adapted his plans to brilliant effect as Liverpool struggled to cope with Villa\u2019s fluid attack. Christian Benteke is congratulated by Aston Villa team-mate Fabian Delph after scoring at Wembley . The Villa manager said: \u2018We changed the way we played. We normally go very direct, and use our pace down the sides, I think Liverpool would have expected us to do that. \u2018But we played it short through the thirds and caused some problems in the little pockets of areas. They were a little bit bamboozled to be honest. \u2018We needed to create a threat. I\u2019m not sure Liverpool tried to second-guess what we were going to do but I don\u2019t think they would have expected that.\u2019 \u2018We looked Liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two No.10s with Jack Grealish and Charles N\u2019Zogbia and it turned out that way. They got them on the back foot. \u2018We needed to get players in support of Christian Benteke. I thought our game plan worked perfectly. We weren\u2019t worried about what Liverpool were going to do. We just knew if we played like we can we were going to cause them a lot of problems.\u2019 Brendan Rodgers conceded his side had been second best, but praised captain Gerrard, who had a late header cleared off the line. Aston Villa players chase Delph after the England midfielder made it 2-1 with 36 minutes left on the clock . \u2018He was doing everything, everything he possibly could to help the team,\u2019 said the Liverpool boss. \u2018I thought he was excellent. But collectively we didn't perform well enough to get a victory.\u2019 Sherwood kept faith with Grealish, the 19-year-old academy graduate, after handing him his first Premier League start against Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. He did not disappoint, playing a part in Benteke\u2019s equaliser, then setting up Delph\u2019s winner. \u2018The bigger the stage the better he plays, the more he relishes it,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018That\u2019s the sign of a good talent. Jack\u2019s someone I looked at before I was at the club and when I\u2019ve seen him in training, if you give him an instruction he sticks to the plan. He\u2019s got a big future at the football club.\u2019 Delph and team-mate Ashley Westwood celebrate their FA Cup win over Liverpool at Wembley . Grealish, who wears children\u2019s shinpads and socks rolled down, won two free-kicks for his team through dribbling with the ball. \u2018He\u2019s very durable,\u2019 added Sherwood. \u2018You should see the size of his legs, he\u2019s still a kid, he\u2019s still learning. He takes more kicks in training than he does on the pitch so he\u2019 s getting a lot of practice fending off those kicks \u2013 he probably needs bigger pads!\u2019 Benteke scored his ninth goal in seven games to level Philippe Countinho\u2019s opening goal, before Delph found the net for the second time under Sherwood, following his quarter-final goal against West Bromwich Albion. He failed to score under Paul Lambert this season. \u2018When I came to the club Fabian Delph had just signed a new contract, he had an opportunity to go to some of the teams in the top four. He showed a lot of loyalty to Aston Villa. I need characters like that, who put themselves on the line, show that spirit. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring . \u2018I\u2019ve never seen him have a bad game here at Wembley for England and he\u2019s not had a bad one today, so hopefully he plays well in the final. \u2018He can add goals to his game, he has so much energy he can get into the final third and score. He\u2019s nicked a couple of goals for me already. I just want to encourage him to do that and then he\u2019ll be too expensive for anyone to buy!\u2019 On Benteke, Sherwood added: \u2018He\u2019s done that consistently for me. When I first come in I couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d only scored 12 goals with that strike force. I saw something wrong and viewed the tapes and saw they weren\u2019t getting the service.\u2019 Coutinho spreads his arms out wide after scoring during his side's surprise FA Cup defeat . Sherwood praised Villa\u2019s 32,000 fans and turned his attention to Arsenal. \u2018They were fantastic. It\u2019s easy to support your team when they\u2019re winning but even at 1-0 down I thought they were great and dragged the boys back. \u2018I watched the other semi-final yesterday and I saw how calm Arsene Wenger was after the game. But he probably realises there\u2019s nothing won. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be Arsene Wenger after that final whistle, I was just delighted and I had to spill out them emotions. \u2018We\u2019ll be the underdogs, the pressure is on Arsenal, they\u2019re the holders and they\u2019ll want to win it again. We realise we\u2019ve got a lot of hard work between now and then to secure our Premier League safety and then come back here and take the game to Arsenal.\u2019 Benteke leaps in the air after levelling the scoreline \u00a0by hitting the back of the net in the 36th minute .",
