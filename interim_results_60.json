As Real Madrid prepare for their La Liga clash against Granada at the Bernabeu on Sunday, Benzema shared a video of him singing along to Tupac's classic track 'Check Out Time'. Tupac's track 'All Eyez on me' might have been a more suitable choice for the Los Blancos star, however, as Benzema looks to add to his goal tally of 20 goals in all competitions so far this season. Real Madrid and France forward Karim Benzema sings along to Tupac in his\u00a0Bugatti Veyron . Benzema boldly stated earlier this week that he can win the Ballon d'Or award during his career. The France international is confident his club success at the Bernabeu can force his way into contention for the prestigious award. However, Benzema's Real team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo has picked up the last two accolades for the world's best footballer whereas Barcelona talisman Lionel Messi prevailed between 2009-12. Benzema vents his frustration during France's recent 3-1 loss to Brazil at the Stade de France in Paris . Despite the duo's dominance, Benzema is adamant he can compete for the title if he continues to perform for Real Madrid and at international level. 'If I keep winning titles then I can win this award in future,' he told Le Parisien. 'We have Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, the two best players. We know I won't reach 80 or 100 goals in a season. They can do that.' Benzema (right) has scored 20 goals, in all competitions, for Real Madrid this season .",

The image, which is believed to come from a firebrand American religious group called 'The Disciples of the New Dawn' in the U.S, has been circulating on mother's groups in Australia. University of Sydney's Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz told Daily Mail Australia the image represents a broader anti-caesarean sentiment which has harmful consequences for women who should be choosing caesareans for health reasons. An offensive image circulating social media which endeavours to shame women who have undergone caesareans . \u2018They are suggesting that it's the woman's own fault if she need a caesarean. That\u2019s like saying it\u2019s your fault that have an inflamed appendix, or bowel cancer. It\u2019s plain stupid.\u2019 The world-renowned gynaecologist says a drive to reduce the rates of C-sections is forcing obstetricians to 'act against their own better professional judgment.' \u2018While it sits on the the extreme end of the caesarean spectrum, it\u2019s an attitude which is actually widespread in Australia. That\u2019s why I feel it needs to be addressed.\u2019 Professor Dietz said the sharp rise in Caesareans since the 1980\u2019s has triggered a strong movement from people trying to curb the rates. Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births . Professor of Gynecology Hans Peter Dietz said the image represents an attitude which is widespread in Australia . \u2018The reality is that your average newborn is much bigger now than in the past, and for some women Caesareans are the safest option. It\u2019s downright dangerous to deny women that right.\u2019 Last year the World Health Organisation said the number of caesarean surgeries needed to drop to 10 to 15 per cent of births.

    "text": "An offensive image circulating on social media, originating from an American religious group, is being condemned by doctors for shaming mothers who have had caesarean sections. The image implies that women who have C-sections are \"too lazy\" to give birth naturally.  \n\nDoctors, like Professor Hans Peter Dietz, argue this reflects a harmful anti-caesarean sentiment that ignores legitimate medical reasons for the procedure. While the World Health Organization aims to reduce C-section rates to 10-15%, experts warn that denying women this option when medically necessary is dangerous. The campaign is seen as an attempt to pressure mothers into adhering to the WHO's recommendation, disregarding individual circumstances and medical advice.",

The striker has scored 31 times for MK Dons and Wolves - just one ahead of Tottenham hotshot Kane. Afobe bagged 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before January - including two in their 4-0 League Cup win over Manchester United - and has added 12 more since joining Wolves from Arsenal on a permanent deal. Benik Afobe says he feels 'unstoppable' at the moment as he aims to become the country's top scorer . The Molineux hitman is expected to make his 50th appearance of the season at Wigan on Saturday and after his breakthrough campaign Afobe's confidence is sky high. 'I had self belief but when you play week in, week out you're going to get more confidence - it's a different type of confidence - it's one to know you're unstoppable,' he told Press Association Sport. 'At the moment we do analysis on the other team, the defenders, the keeper, and you hear this player was playing in the Premier League and has experience but I don't care at all, not one bit. 'It doesn't matter what league I'm playing in I'm going to score. 'It's the mentality you've got to change to be a top goalscorer and I've realised that.

'All the top goalscorers who score week in, week out like (Lionel) Messi and (Sergio) Aguero, they believe they are going to score before they've had a chance and that's the only difference between a top goalscorer and an average striker.' Wolves have two games left in the Sky Bet Championship and are three points outside the play-offs after Afobe's goal rescued a 1-1 draw with Ipswich on Saturday. Kane has five matches left in the Barclays Premier League with Spurs but Afobe is focused on scoring himself and is not jealous of Kane's success after he dropped out of the top flight for regular football. Harry Kane has been in red hot form this season and scored the third away to Newcastle on Sunday . 'He has five games and I have two,' said the confident but grounded 22-year-old. 'I have played with a lot of these players Harry, Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere who's my friend, but everyone has their own destiny. 'I have never looked at one player and thought 'that could have been me'. I think that's another reason why I'm doing well. 'I never compare myself to any player. The way people don't succeed in life is that they worry about other people too much. 'I wanted 30 goals. I got to 30 and now I want to keep scoring, I want to get to 35. People have asked 'what's my favourite goal?' I always say 'the next one'.' Afobe scored a double against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup while on loan at MK Dons .",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nFloyd Mayweather's spending habits are well known but his car dealer has revealed that the boxer bizarrely rang him at 3am to order a Bugatti - insisting the car was to be in his driveway in just 12 hours. The \u00a31.5million valued super-car was delivered just 11 hours later, and was added to his collection of impressive motors. Obi Okeke, who owns Fusion Luxury Motors, was interviewed on the video on Mayweather's Facebook page and spoke about the very late phone call he received. Floyd Mayweather rang his car dealer at 3am to order a \u00a31.5million Bugatti to be delivered in 12 hours . Obi Okele, the owner of Fusion Luxury Motors, was given the task of getting Mayweather the Bugatti . He said: 'The most challenging thing I've ever done for Floyd is when he called me at three o'clock in the morning and said, Obi, I want a Bugatti and I want one in my driveway in 12 hours. 'I then showered, went into my office, did some work and hopped on a plane and got the car, in his driveway, in 11 hours and that makes me a better person, it makes me work harder, it makes me not limit myself, so those are the things that rub off on me from him.' It's not the only request that Okele has had to deal with from Mayweather's extravagant demands, as the fighter once turned up at the dealership at 2am - walking out with a Ferrari Enzo. 'I got a call from overseas in the Middle East that there was a US-spec Enzo for sale, so I hopped on a plane and flew to Abu Dhabi. I then transacted the car and put it in a Boeing 777 passenger plane and flew it out of Abu Dhabi. 'So Floyd came to the dealership and he kept coming and looking at the car. Then he came in one night around two in the morning and said, \"Obi, I wanna buy two Ferrari 458s,\" and that's what he said. 'Then I said OK, then he pauses for a minute and goes, \"Obi, I'm not going to buy them 458s, I want to buy that Enzo and I want to buy it now. Lets go.\"' Mayweather's mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao is just three weeks away and the undefeated champion continues to work in the gym and keep his impressive record intact. This Bugatti is similar to the one Mayweather purchased at 3am and is worth an estimated \u00a31.5million . The interior of the super-car is in pristine condition and is one of a number of Bugatti's Mayweather owns .",

Okeke recounted his experiences in an interview on Mayweather's Facebook page, noting how these challenges motivate him to work harder. These stories came as Mayweather was preparing for his mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao, while continuing to add to his collection of luxury cars.",

They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B. She says: . When Nigel and I met as students in 1993 we soon discovered we both absolutely loved the 1940s. I had a beautiful mirror from the period that still hangs over our fireplace. We love the style because there\u2019s such an attention to detail in everything from the handles through to the surfaces. When we moved in together after university, we\u2019d scour the local North London markets for 1940s pieces while checking out bric-a-brac shops and antique dealers on holiday. I\u2019ve always found other people are more interested in earlier items from Victorian, Edwardian or Georgian times, so we\u2019re usually left to take our pick. Scroll down for video . Claire Nugent, 43, and Nigel Morter, 47, have been married for 14 years. They restored a 1940s airfield control tower in Norfolk and now run it as a B&B . In 2011, our dreams came true when we bought a World War II airfield control tower near Wells-next-the-Sea for \u00a3295,000. It had been used as accommodation or a grain store since the war so needed a lot of work \u2014 we spent nearly \u00a3200,000 getting it back to how it used to be. We stripped out the laminated flooring and scraped off the modern wallpaper, replacing it with original parquet flooring from a Sheffield school, and painting the walls. The bathrooms were the biggest source of stress. We once bought a cast-iron bath on eBay only to discover it was still installed. We had to pay someone \u00a3250 to drive up with pipe cutters and spanners to dig it out of the bathroom. But it was worth it. Another time we bought a pink bathroom suite then discovered the toilet wasn\u2019t of the period. It took us four months of calling reclamation yards and googling to find the one we wanted. It cost \u00a3400 from a reclamation yard in the West Country \u2014 the most we\u2019ve paid for something. While life has been made easier by the arrival of eBay, it does have added stresses. We spent New Year\u2019s Eve two years ago desperately driving around trying to find a signal so I could bid on some concertina dividing doors. Eventually we managed it with 15 seconds to spare and got them for \u00a3200. They said: 'We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life' Our biggest expense was the windows, as control towers have so many. We spent around \u00a345,000 having custom-made replicas, but ours are thankfully double glazed. It\u2019s taken us three years to do up the tower, and while the B&B part is finished, we\u2019re still working on our private living areas. I invited my ten-year-old nephew to stay and showed him photos of how it had been when we moved in. Seeing all the modern flooring and wallpaper, he asked: \u2018Auntie Claire, why have you wrecked your house?\u2019 We\u2019re so pleased with the results though. My favourite piece is an original Anglepoise workbench lamp in our kitchen, which came from one of the metal huts in the grounds. And the enamel fireplaces cost \u00a3200 each, but they add to the historical feel of the building. We\u2019ve become really wrapped up in the history of airfields. We\u2019ve even met local veterans who flew from the airfield. It\u2019s been great to bring this great tower back to life. My biggest weakness is 50s cocktail bars - at one stage I had six . Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk. She says: . I\u2019ve always loved the flamboyance of the 1950s \u2014 they were so kitsch and glamorous. Interiors of the era are full of texture, colours and shapes, so there\u2019s always something exciting, quirky or beautiful to look at in our home. Nigel and I have been together for 11 years, but we\u2019ve shared a house only for the past three. We originally had our own homes, and mine was full of 1950s memorabilia, but his wasn\u2019t. So, luckily, Nigel gave me the go-ahead to renovate his place, where we now live, two years ago. On the outside it\u2019s a regular 1930s semi, but inside it\u2019s like stepping back into the 1950s. In total, the work cost about \u00a310,000. Emma Edwards, 46, lives with her partner Nigel Preston, 57, in Manchester. She runs the vintage website missbamboo.co.uk and, at one stage, had six 1950s cocktail bars (left) The most extravagant item I\u2019ve bought is Hawaiian vintage tropical wallpaper that has a pink tropical flower and island print. I got four rolls from a specialist website for \u00a3100 each. But it\u2019s worth it. I have found a few bargains, too, such as a 1950s pearlised pale green bedroom set for \u00a340 from a flea market in Manchester in the early 1990s. I love it. Once I found two pink melamine chests of drawers on eBay that I just had to have. We had to head to Glasgow to collect them, but as we were going on holiday the next day, our car was being serviced. I made Nigel take the train with me and we had to lug them back ourselves \u2014 they were so heavy and awkward that we had to stand in the space between the carriages the whole way home. She said: 'I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave'. Her radio is also a blast from the past . My biggest 1950s weakness is bamboo cocktail bars because I love the Tiki, or Polynesian-style cocktail culture, which was a big part of the era. If I see a rare bamboo cocktail bar cabinet I can\u2019t help but buy it \u2014 at one point I owned six. I\u2019ve sold two and have one in storage, but I still have two in my lounge and one in my conservatory. They cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200. I do have modern things mixed in, but only when they have a retro 50s look, for example our microwave. The TV is the only modern-looking item, I hate its appearance, but it\u2019s great to watch a vintage movie on and keeps Nigel happy. Maybe at some point we will make a cool mid-century surround or cabinet to disguise it. I wouldn\u2019t want my house to look like everyone else\u2019s \u2014 that would just be boring. Yes, I know it's kitch but that's why I love the 1960s . Ursula Forbush, 48, is single, a manager for a charity and lives near Bristol. She says: . From the red glass vases and psychedelic wallpaper, to the Formica tables and G-plan dining suite, everything about my two-bedroom terrace home is a tribute to the late Sixties. I fell in love with the era as a twentysomething in the Eighties while feeling uninspired by the New Romantic music and the fashions at the time. After digging around in my mum\u2019s record collection I realised I loved Sixties music, particularly The Beatles and Rolling Stones, and devoured books about the decade. Ursula Forbush, 48, is single. She is a manager for a charity, lives near Bristol and adores anything kitsch, spending hours running round flea markets . Covetous of the style of Pattie Boyd, Marianne Faithfull and Edie Sedgwick \u2014 Andy Warhol\u2019s muse \u2014 I scoured the second-hand market in Leicester, where I grew up, for Sixties fashions. I have a like-minded friend who completely decorated her home in Sixties style, and I vowed to one day have my own Sixties abode. The first thing I did when I bought my home 12 years ago was to have genuine Sixties wallpaper put up. I imported a funky pink and brown swirled paper for about \u00a320 a roll from Holland which adorns one wall of my dining room, while in the hallway there is orange flowery wallpaper from Italy, and a calming blue pattern in my bedroom. At the windows hang original Sixties curtains bought from second-hand shops. I adore anything kitsch and spend hours rummaging at auctions, car-boot sales, flea markets and in charity shops, never paying more than a few pounds. A Sixties lamp with large swirls all over the tall shade was one of the more expensive items, at \u00a3100 from eBay. She said: 'Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away' I have a record player reminiscent of a white space helmet, and there are original white fluffy flokati rugs on my lounge floor. Formica tables are scattered around the house and the walls are hung with prints of iconic paintings like the Chinese Girl by Vladimir Tretchikoff. In the kitchen is an old Kenwood mixer and Sixties crockery and glassware. I also have an orange slow cooker, plus Boots heated curlers, and hood-style hairdryer which cost \u00a35 from a charity shop \u2014 I don\u2019t use the hair gadgets in case they blow up. Although I don\u2019t like modern decor and furnishings and have very little of either, I\u2019ve had to be practical with certain items. An old twin tub wouldn\u2019t fit in my kitchen so I\u2019ve got a modern washing machine. And while my TV is also new, I paid more for one that\u2019s smaller, white and in keeping with the white fibreglass Sixties table on which it sits. Every night I come home to my Sixties bubble, switch on my old record player, listen to some vinyl, and all the stresses of 2015 melt away.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nAs a wealth management consultant for a prestigious London firm, Craig Lister is used to keeping his cool. But lately, that's become rather more difficult. Craig, 54, is on hormone therapy for prostate cancer, which starves cancer cells by reducing levels of testosterone in the body - and has the side-effect of hot flushes. 'I have about ten to 12 flushes a day, and six to eight at night,' says Craig, a Yorkshireman who lives in Watford, Hertfordshire, with wife Sue, a teacher, 52, and their three children, George, 22, Evie, 20, and Joseph, 18. Craig, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. He is now well and his tumours have shrunk . 'I know when one's coming. The feeling suddenly builds up as if you've gone into a sauna. Within minutes I'm in full sweat. Five or ten minutes later, it's gone.' Craig has taken to carrying a spare shirt in his briefcase when he goes to meet clients. 'I'll turn up to a lunch and suddenly have a hot sweat and my shirt will be soaked,' he says. 'I nip off to the loos and have a wash and change.' Hormone therapy, usually given in the form of regular injections or implants, is the first treatment offered to men with advanced prostate cancer - where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It can't cure the cancer, but can help keep it under control. Hormone therapy is also given alongside radiotherapy to some men with localised prostate cancer to shrink the cancer and make it easier to treat. The jabs typically contain drugs called luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) blockers. These act on the pituitary gland in the brain, to stop the production of hormones which are released into the bloodstream and bind with cells in the testicles to make testosterone. Even though the cancer is now microscopic he is still taking hormone treatment . The majority of prostate cancers rely on the hormone to grow. Lowering the amount in the body means it's less able to spread. In England alone, 13,000 men receive the treatment every year - in the form of jabs given monthly or every three months according to the charity Prostate Cancer UK. However, blocking testosterone can cause a variety of side-effects, explains Ali Rooke, a specialist nurse at the charity. 'Testosterone is a man's natural source of energy, so along with hot flushes we often see fatigue. It also has an important role in sexual function, so there can be a loss of libido,' she says. 'There can be mood swings and depression; some men also report breast swelling, nipple tenderness and weight gain around the middle. All of these are similar to what women go through during the menopause, when levels of their equivalent hormone, oestrogen, start to fall.' Hormone therapy also raises the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, and can cause bone thinning, because testosterone is important for bone density. Studies by Prostate Cancer UK have found that 80 per cent of men having hormone therapy will suffer hot flushes, and 27 per cent of these say it is the side-effect that troubles them the most. This rings true for Craig. 'People don't tell you much about hormone therapy at the beginning,' he says. 'I am basically a menopausal man. I have mood swings and I've put on two-and-a-half stone. But the worst thing has been the hot sweats. I'm up a few times a night, sometimes having to change the sheets and it's tiring. 'Of course, this wakes Sue up, too, and then she's worrying. 'She used to have hot flushes and so she's very sympathetic. The difference with me is that I don't know if they will ever end.' Men with advanced prostate cancer could be on hormone therapy for the rest of their life, says Ali Rooke. 'But men who are on it along with radiotherapy tend to only have it for up to three years until the cancer has been treated.' She says the charity receives hundreds of calls every year from men struggling with hot flushes and side-effects of hormone therapy. 'Men are warned about side-effects, but clinic appointment times are not long, so doctors can't realistically talk through them all in detail. It's also hard to predict what side-effects a man will have and how he will respond.' There are treatments to alleviate hot flushes, such as drugs based on the female hormone progesterone, which has an effect like testosterone but doesn't fuel the growth of cancer cells. Some men find that complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, or herbal supplements, such as sage tea or black cohosh, help, but the benefits are yet to be proven clinically. But now new research suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, a psychological technique and talking therapy, could help. This causes hot flushes and night sweats . A trial on prostate cancer patients at King's College London, published in March, has shown such impressive results that it is likely to be offered nationally. CBT works by helping people understand the links between their beliefs, thoughts and behaviour. It's a recognised treatment for anxiety and other mental health conditions. Myra Hunter, professor of clinical health psychology at King's, has previously found that CBT reduces hot flushes in menopausal women, and breast cancer patients who are experiencing them as a result of treatments that reduce levels of oestrogen. 'Beliefs about hot flushes can exacerbate the symptoms,' she says. Professor Hunter believes that by replacing overly negative thoughts about hot flushes with more helpful, positive ones, they will have less of an impact. Her latest study recruited 68 men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer, all of whom were experiencing at least ten hot flushes and night sweats a week. Half the group were given treatment as usual (access to doctors and information about the problem) and the other half received a self-help CBT booklet, a CD and two sessions with a psychologist. The men were taught breathing exercises, advised on lifestyle changes and sleep management, and encouraged to challenge negative beliefs and presumptions. 'Women feel hot flushes are a signifier of their age and reproductive status,' says Professor Hunter. 'In our interviews with men, we found the hot flushes signified a threat to their masculinity. 'They felt the hot flushes had social consequences - people would think that there was something wrong with them. And they catastrophised, so if they had one in the night they assumed they'd feel terrible the next day.' After six weeks, the CBT group's hot flushes were 40 per cent less problematic and 36 per cent less frequent, compared with 12 per cent and 16 per cent reductions in the control group. CBT is not always easily available on the NHS. Professor Hunter is hoping to offer her self-help audio guide and booklet for hot flushes free through Prostate Cancer UK, but this has not yet been confirmed. Craig was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer three years ago, at the age of 50, so quality of life is important to him. By the time of his diagnosis, the cancer had spread beyond the prostate to his lungs and to the lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, so surgery was not an option. While the hormone treatment has been helpful, the hot flushes have been hard to deal with. He is about to try a new type of radiotherapy, but expects to be on hormone therapy indefinitely. However, he says taking the right attitude to hot flushes has helped him hugely. 'From the beginning I've been open about my condition, so all my friends and clients know why I have hot flushes. 'It's nothing to be embarrassed about. My family and I have learned to live in the now and be grateful for what we've got.' prostatecanceruk.org .",
    "text": "Craig Lister, a 54-year-old wealth management consultant from Watford, is undergoing hormone therapy for advanced prostate cancer, leading to frequent hot flushes as a side effect. Diagnosed in 2012, Craig's treatment lowers testosterone to control cancer growth, but causes significant side effects like hot flushes, mood swings, weight gain, and fatigue, akin to menopause symptoms. While hormone therapy can't cure the cancer, it helps manage it and is essential for men with advanced or spreading prostate cancer. Many men, including Craig, experience severe hot flushes, which can be distressing and disruptive. To mitigate these effects, some patients turn to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as recent studies show it can significantly reduce the frequency and impact of hot flushes. Despite the challenges, Craig maintains a positive outlook, openly discussing his condition with friends and clients and focusing on gratitude and living in the present.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\n8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is \u2018shameful\u2019 to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. \u2018People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.\u2019 Ending screening at 73 \u2018doesn\u2019t take account of the fact that ageing is changing\u2019, adds Nat Lievesley. \u2018It\u2019s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.\u2019 Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

    "text": "Summary:\n\nThe article discusses the debate surrounding breast cancer screening age limits in the UK. Key points include:\n\n1. Currently, women aged 50-70 are invited for mammograms every three years.\n\n2. MPs are calling for the upper age limit to be extended, as 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed with breast cancer annually.\n\n3. The age limit is set to increase to 73 by the end of 2016, but critics argue this is not high enough.\n\n4. Older women are less likely to receive certain treatments for breast cancer compared to younger patients.\n\n5. There are concerns about potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment if screening is extended to all older women.\n\n6. Women can request mammograms at any age, but many are unaware of this option once invitations stop.\n\n7. Some experts suggest personalizing screening decisions based on individual factors like life expectancy and breast cancer risk.\n\n8. The article highlights the importance of breast awareness and early detection, regardless of age.\n\nThe debate centers on balancing the benefits of early detection with the risks of unnecessary treatment in older women.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA heartbroken father told yesterday how his daughter had been given hard drugs by dealers targeting schools. In an emotional open letter, he told how the \u2018bright and beautiful\u2019 GCSE pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine, ecstasy, methadone and \u2018party drug\u2019 meow meow. The father \u2013 identified only as John to protect his family\u2019s privacy \u2013 warned that Class A drugs were widely available to children, and urged schools and police to get tough. He said dealers made the drugs \u2018incredibly cheap and available\u2019 to hook their young customers. A father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground (file pic posed by a model) His daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills, sometimes without knowing what she was taking. She had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know. The father has sent the open letter to his local council, South Gloucestershire, pleading for action to combat a \u2018serious drug problem\u2019. The man described himself as a single parent to a son and daughter \u2013 referred to as Jack and Jill \u2013 who both went to a local secondary. \u2018Two weeks ago I discovered that Jill had been taking Class A drugs for three to four months,\u2019 he said. \u2018How dumb am I not to know? But do you know the signs as a parent?\u2019 The father said he had initially dismissed changes in his daughter\u2019s behaviour as \u2018teenage moodiness\u2019. He has now written an open letter (above) to his local authority, South Gloucestershire, begging them to take the issue more seriously asking if a young person has to die before the problem is addressed . But he told the Bristol Post: \u2018She came to me and said she had got caught up with a group and started taking cocaine and ecstasy. \u2018I had noticed she had been a bit off but I thought it was a teenage daughter rebelling against her dad \u2026 it just didn\u2019t occur to me and I felt na\u00efve and stupid.\u2019 Horrified by his daughter\u2019s revelations, the father said he went to her school and police but officers were \u2018aggressive and threatening\u2019 when his daughter volunteered information, including the names of alleged dealers. He accused authorities of \u2018pretending a problem doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled, adding: \u2018Does a young person here have to die?\u2019 The father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs. The father, only known as John, has called on South Gloucestershire Council to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools . He told how he had limited his daughter\u2019s use of her mobile phone and social media, apparently to stop her falling back into drug use. He said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked. The father said his relationship with his daughter had hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse, saying: \u2018She hates me now.\u2019 But, in the absence of help from authorities, he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to \u2018take control\u2019 to help their children. The despairing father said he could not offer a \u2018simple answer\u2019 but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored. South Gloucestershire council refused to comment and said it was a matter for police. Inspector Adrian Fallows, a neighbourhood police manager for South Gloucestershire, said: \u2018We are working with schools to educate young people about drugs and also to deal firmly with any drugs issues that may arise. \u2018The supply, production and use of drugs in our communities, and the acquisitive crimes associated with drugs, is a serious matter. \u2018We will do whatever we can to protect young people by disrupting the system and bringing to justice anyone dealing drugs and profiting from crime.\u2019",

Speaking to Style.com, Gigi said: 'From Kendall I learned how to deal with the haters. She has a really good sense of when to stand up [on social media] and when to back off.' Scroll down for video . Gigi Hadid has credited her best friend Kendall Jenner, right, for helping her deal with social media haters . And it's not only Kendall, 19, who Gigi has taken social media tips from as she believes former Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss is comfortable with her social media persona. She added: 'I think she does such a good job of showing who she is. She lets her personality really shine in her Instagram.' While Kendall Jenner is taking the fashion world by the storm, she has her fair share of haters. The fledgling model's meteoric rise as a professional runway model reportedly sparked the ire and resentment of some of her colleagues, according to a report. At New York Fashion Week, Kendall was allegedly bullied by her fellow models, who even went so far as to put cigarettes out in her drink. In another incident, Lexi Boling, along with fellow model Binx Walton, left cruel comments on a pre-show image of Kendall shared on Vogue Germany's Instagram feed. The 19-year-old model took inspiration from the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star when it came to learning how to deal with negative feedback . Gigi said that Kendall has a really good sense of when to stand up [on social media] and when to back off . Lexi, 21, tagged her friend Binx, 20, in the comment: '@binxwalton she's never looked better,' with a crying with laughter emoticon. Teen Vogue cover star Binx replied: 'That's f****d up,' with the same animated laughing face. The two comments have since been deleted from the Vogue Germany photo, but followers' horrified responses remain. Lexi has since apologised for the comment. In a statement issued via a representative to E! News, she said: 'I wasn't thinking and made a silly comment. Kendall's had a killer NYFW. A big congrats to her!' Gigi, centre, is best friends with fellow supermodels Cara Delevingne, left, and Kendall, right . The latter remark is certainly true. Kendall is unarguably one of the world's most in-demand stars. Her appearance in a Chanel fashion show in New York City on Tuesday was case in point. Kendall and her best friend Cara Delevingne were linked as they closed the Paris-Salzburg 2014/15 Metiers d'Art Collection at Park Avenue Armory in two very unique and elaborate ensembles - Kendall in black, Cara in white.

That is the verdict of colleague Andrew Thornton when trying to explain what has made AP McCoy such a dominant force in his sport. Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Thornton has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness McCoy's entire career, from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar. AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career . McCoy has two rides at Sandown on Saturday before he retires from professional racing for good . 'It is a bit like watching Lionel Messi on a horse,' said Thornton. 'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill. 'When he was with Martin Pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle\u00a0will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals\u00a0in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.' Richard Hughes, champion Flat jockey, is impressed by McCoy's legendary focus. 'I was on holiday with him in Portugal. AP played two days' golf, flew home to ride at Sedgefield and then back out to play the final day. We told him he was mad.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nEd Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, according to FTSE 100 bosses . Seven out of 10 business chiefs at Britain's biggest companies think Ed Miliband would be a 'catastrophe' for Britain, a survey has revealed. The poll of FTSE 100 chairman has revealed overwhelming support for David Cameron to remain Prime Minister, despite the widespread business concern over his pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. It comes just days after more than 100 company bosses signed a letter warning against a Labour government. It also echoes controversial remarks by the Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina who sparked fury after claiming it would be a 'catastrophe' for the UK if Labour won the election. The poll of 35 business chairman, by the headhunters Korn Ferry, is a further blow to Labour which is struggling to repair its relationship with big business after a series of controversial policy announcements. Mr Miliband last week vowed to ban 90 per cent of zero-hours contracts and  unveiled proposals to make it easier for workers to take their bosses to court for unfair dismissal. He also confirmed plans to raise corporation tax for the first time in 40 years to raise cash for a \u00a3400 cut in business rates for smaller firms. One of the FTSE 100 bosses surveyed, who did not want to be named, said businesses could work with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and its economics chief Ed Balls. But he said Mr Miliband's 'tone and rhetoric' had proved 'deeply disturbing', adding: 'At times his language is vitriolic and he appears to completely misunderstand business.' Mr Umunna, speaking on Radio 5 Live today, Umunna insisted Labour was no anti-business and defended Mr Miliband's recent announcemtn that Labour would all-but outlaw zero-hours contracts. Mr Umunna admitted not all zero-hours contracts were 'awful and bad', but insisted many workers were being exploited. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband has vowed to force companies to offer staff a full time contract if they have been working regular hours for three months. Mr Umunna said: 'I think this will be massively helpful. There are 1.8million zero hours contracts now and I think this will transform people's lives.' The shadow business secretary has also pointed to Labour's refusal to offer a European referendum as a policy which business supported. David Cameron and George Osborne, out campaigning today, have jumped on business criticism of the Labour Party to boost their core campaign message that only the Tories can be trusted with the economy . He said: 'Business people have been very impressed that Ed took a decision on a matter of principle on the in-out referendum. It would have been easier to dance to Nigel Farage's tune, as the Conservatives have done.' Last week, Mr Umunna and a host of other Labour figures hit out at Britain's top business leaders after they backed the Conservatives' economic plan and urged voters not to risk a 'change of course'. In a highly unusual intervention just weeks from the general election, the business chiefs claimed a Labour government would 'put the recovery at risk'. Mr Miliband said the letter was not a surprise and only showed that the Tories were on the side of 'a few big firms and individuals at the top'. Mr Umunna, meanwhile, dismissed the signatories as a 'cosy little club', while Labour peer John Precott went further criticising them as 'tax dodgers, Tory voters and non-doms'. Mr Cameron, however, insisted the intervention was 'unprecedented' and claimed it sent a 'very powerful message'. The business chiefs who signed the letter run companies with well known retail brands such as Primark, Iceland, Ladbrokes and Costa Coffee. Bosses behind big name retailers, drinks and restaurants have backed the Tory economic plan, including (top row) Primark and Costa and (bottom row) Ladbrokes, Cobra, Tango and Iceland . Executives at consumer brands such as Cobra beer, Britvic, Silver Spoon, Kingsmill, Thorntons, Robinsons, Tango and London Pride are also on the list. Embarrassingly for Labour, the list of business chiefs includes several who supported the governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. However, Mr Miliband said the letter only served to expose the choice at the election. He said: 'Businesses have come out today to say they want lower business taxes and, you know, that doesn't surprise me. 'But it does also go to the wider choice at this election. The Conservatives really believe that if all of the few corporations and individuals at the top are doing well, the wealth will magically trickle down for everybody else. 'We have tried that experiment over the last few years and it hasn't worked. We have seen falling living standards and falling wages and insecurity at work. I just have a different view about the way the country succeeds.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA former High Court judge who led the inquiry into the Bradford stadium fire which killed 56 football fans has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident saying they are 'nonsense'. A new book by author Martin Fletcher has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. The official inquiry into the blaze, led by Mr Justice Oliver Popplewell, concluded that the fire was an accident, probably caused by a spectator dropping a cigarette into rubbish that had accumulated under an old timber stand at the Valley Parade ground. Former Bradford City chairman Stafford Heginbotham, left, with Mr Justice Popplewell in the aftermath of the Bradford City fire. Today, the former judge has dismissed claims the blaze was not an accident . The stand at the Valley Parade ground burns after a fire in 1985. 56 football fans were killed in the tragedy . Today Sir Oliver was asked about the new allegations in an interview on BBC Radio Leeds, where he rubbished Mr Fletcher's claims. The retired judge said the main flaw in the argument that the fire was arson was that the stand involved had no insurance value as it was due for demolition. He also added that the fire was examined by experienced and thorough investigators, who found nothing suspicious and that no question of arson was ever raised in civil legal proceedings. He explained: 'I'm sorry to spoil what is obviously a very good story but I'm afraid it's nonsense for a number of reasons.' Sir Oliver also rejected claims his inquiry was held too quickly, three weeks after the fire. He added: 'I can quite understand after having previous fires some suspicion being raised but, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we conducted our inquiry perfectly properly and I have no reason believe it was other than an accident.' The new claims about the fire at Valley Parade are contained in the book Fifty-Six by Mr Fletcher, who was 12 at the time and escaped the blaze. Author Martin Fletcher\u00a0has revealed a series of other blazes at businesses owned by or associated with Stafford Heginbotham, the club's chairman at the time of the tragedy in 1985. He is pictured here with his mother Susan as a 12-year-old . The fire broke out near to half-time during Bradford's game against Lincoln City on May 11, 1985 and within four minutes the stand was completely ablaze. Mr Fletcher lost three generations of his family in the tragedy, including his 11-year-old brother Andrew, the fire's youngest victim, as well as his father John, 34, uncle Peter, 32, and grandfather Eddie, 63. The book, published today and being serialised in The Guardian, does not make any direct allegations but Mr Fletcher says Mr Heginbotham\u2019s history with fires, which he claims resulted in payouts totalling around \u00a327 million in today\u2019s terms, warranted further investigation. He asks: 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham had been?' The disaster also occurred at a time, according to Mr Fletcher\u2019s evidence, when the businessman was in desperate financial trouble - and two days after he discovered it would cost \u00a32million to bring the ground up to safety standards required by Bradford\u2019s promotion from the old Third Division. The fire at the ground broke out close to half-time during Bradford's home game against Lincoln City on May, 11, 1985 . An official inquiry found that the fire was started by accidentally when a fan discarded a cigarette on to rubbish below the timber stand . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, which took place three weeks after the fire . Mr Fletcher is the only survivor to publicly challenge the official inquiry, describing it as inadequate and saying it took place far too close to the event. Meanwhile Mr Heginbotham\u2019s son James, 47, has defended his father, who died in 1995. He told told the Daily Mirror: 'When you actually do your homework and see what he did for Bradford City Football Club it is a sickening accusation. It is just absolutely ridiculous. 'He never recovered from the fire. The stress of it is what killed him eventually. 'He\u2019s no longer here to defend himself. It\u2019s a real shame it has come to this.' Meanwhile, yesterday former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said the new allegations do not justify a new inquiry into the disaster. The remains of the stand after the fire. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the blaze, which also injured 265 people . Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Valley Parade to survey the damage to the stand and pay her respects with her husband Dennis . Mr Sutcliffe, MP for Bradford South and deputy leader of Bradford City Council at the time of the tragedy, said he knew Mr Heginbotham 'flew by the seat of his pants' in terms of the finances of the club, but remains convinced by the conclusion of the inquiry. West Yorkshire Police said the force would consider any new evidence about the fire. Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, of the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The jury at the inquest in 1985 delivered a verdict of misadventure. 'However should any evidence come to light which was not available to Her Majesty\u2019s Coroner at the original inquest, then we will consider its significance and take appropriate action.' A minute\u2019s silence is due to be held at every Premier League and Football League match on Saturday, April 25 to mark the forthcoming 30th anniversary of the fire. It was the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land. The final of game of the season should have been a day of celebration for Bradford City. Before kick-off the team were presented with the trophy for winning the Third Division title as 11,076 fans watched on. But instead, May 11, 1985 ended in tragedy as flames engulfed the Main Stand at Valley Parade. The Valley Parade blaze is considered the worst stadium fire in the history of British football and prompted important safety changes in grounds across the land . The fire was spotted at 3.40pm towards the end of the first half and within minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. The disaster left 56 supporters dead and a further 265 injured. In the years that followed,  new legislation was introduced governing safety at the nation's sports grounds. The tragedy\u00a0brought about an unprecedented  community spirit in the city, with, among many other initiatives, a fundraising drive for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade.",
    "text": "A new book by Martin Fletcher, a survivor of the 1985 Bradford City stadium fire, raises suspicions about the fire's origin, suggesting it may have been arson connected to the club chairman's history of business fires and financial troubles. However, the judge who led the original inquiry, which ruled the fire an accident, dismisses the claims as \"nonsense,\" emphasizing the lack of insurance value of the stand and thoroughness of the investigation. While Mr. Fletcher's book doesn't make direct accusations, it highlights a pattern of fires associated with the then-chairman, Stafford Heginbotham, raising questions about potential financial motives. Despite this, authorities maintain the fire was accidental, though they are open to reviewing new evidence. The tragedy, which claimed 56 lives, remains a stark reminder of the importance of stadium safety and continues to resonate deeply within the community.",

Grim discovery: Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim . It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire, an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD. The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig. Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes, 54, said: 'It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets. Well preserved: It turned out the 'victim' was in fact a stolen, 915-year-old Peruvian mummy . Forensics: Police were called by the cleaners who made the discovery by an archaeological dig site in\u00a0Trujillo . Wrapped up: The mummified remains were discovered in a box, wrapped in rope, by cleaners in Peru . 'But when I opened it I nearly died of heart attack as I saw this grinning skull staring up at me. 'I had no idea it was an ancient mummy, I thought it was someone who had been murdered so I immediately called the police.' A police spokesman said: 'We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton. 'But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site. 'Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later.' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination. A spokesman there said: 'This is not a Chimu mummy and is most likely pre-Hispanic suggesting it is from another culture pre-dating the Hispanic arrival.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\n(CNN)Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu, Nepal. And they are struggling in the aftermath. Anuradha Koirala, who rescues victims of sex trafficking, has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu that is home to 425 young women and girls. While her primary facility seems structurally unharmed, all of the children have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks, followed by a second earthquake on May 12. The once-vibrant campus has gone from a place of safety and healing to one of uncertainty and worry. \"We are suffering with rain, strong wind. The fear is not gone from us. It is very, very hard,\" said Koirala, the founder of the nonprofit Maiti Nepal and the 2010 CNN Hero of the Year. The public has been warned not to use the main water line due to risk of cholera. Koirala's group is relying on bottled water and is now rationing food. Still, she has offered to take in 200 other girls orphaned by the disaster. \"These girls are most vulnerable, because now people will target them,\" Koirala said. \"They could be victims of any forms of sexual abuse. Maybe rape, maybe they will be trafficked, anything. ... If I get more support I will take as many as I can.\" About five miles away, the wall of Koirala's HIV/AIDS hospice has crumbled. Home to 115 girls, many of whom are terminally ill, the facility is under guard. \"They're not injured, but they are terrified,\" Koirala said. \"Everything is broken in the hospice.\" Koirala's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district, and all of them have been damaged. \"It's really very sad for me and for my children,\" Koirala said. \"This disaster, the noise and the way it shook, I cannot get over it. I was not afraid that I was going to be killed. I was afraid about what is going to happen next.\" Another CNN Hero, Pushpa Basnet, and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence. They are now living on the ground in a nearby field. \"Physically, we are not hurt. But mentally, we are,\" said Basnet, whose Early Childhood Development Center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated. Basnet says the building's walls are all cracked, and the staff is afraid it might fall down. She and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse, taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves. \"It's really cold in the middle of the night; there are lots of fox in the field,\" Basnet said. \"We are really scared.\" They also don't have much water or food, Basnet says. But she is trying to stay positive. \"I think for the time being, whatever we have, we should be happy, you know?  Because at least we have our life,\" she said. \"(My kids) all are safe. That's the most important thing for me.\" Basnet's \"Butterfly Home\" -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake. Basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months, with the opening ceremony set for October. Basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 Hero of the Year. \"When the earthquake hit that land, all my dreams were scattered,\" she said. \"I have to restart again.\" Still, Basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid. To that end, several CNN Heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in Nepal. Jake Wood's disaster relief organization, Team Rubicon, has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in Kathmandu.  The group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the Nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city. Six canine-firefighter search teams from the United States also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts. The teams were trained by Wilma Melville's National Disaster Search Dog Foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers, hazmat experts and doctors. Tom Henderson's ShelterBox, which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies, has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families. Dr. Laura Stachel's group, We Care Solar, sent solar suitcases to health care workers, providing them with light and power as they aid survivors. Arlene Samen's group, One Heart World-Wide, has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies, especially in hard-hit districts. Robin Lim, a disaster response midwife who founded Bumi Sehat, joined Samen in Kathmandu to help the mothers. Doc Hendley's nonprofit, Wine to Water, partnered with Appalachian State University in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in Nepal. The group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly.",
    "text": "In the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Kathmandu, Nepal, two CNN Heroes, Anuradha Koirala and Pushpa Basnet, are among the survivors facing significant challenges. Koirala, founder of Maiti Nepal, has been accommodating 425 girls at her rehabilitation center, which remains intact but faces water and food shortages. Despite these challenges, she is willing to take in more girls orphaned by the disaster. Her HIV/AIDS hospice and other facilities have suffered damage, leaving many frightened. Basnet, who supports children of incarcerated parents, was forced to evacuate with 45 children to a nearby field after their residence was damaged. Despite limited resources, she remains optimistic. In response to the crisis, several other CNN Heroes have mobilized relief efforts, providing medical aid, emergency shelter, water filters, solar power, and birthing centers to the affected populations.",

Over the past week, thousands of the silver fish have died and have been scooped out of Rodrigo de Freitas lake, but city authorities and biologists have argued about the cause. More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench, sparking complaints from neighbours and passers-by. Clearing: Rio's waste management company said it has cleared more than 37 tons of fish, which have been taken to the city's main dump . Olympics: Rodrigo de Freitas lake is set to host the Olympic rowing and canoeing events during next year's Games in\u00a0Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . There is an overwhelming stench coming from the lake and authorities and biologists have argued about about the cause of the deaths . Rubbish collectors will continue to rake the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface until the the mass dying subsides. They are being taken to the city's main dump. The die-offs are common in Rio, where rivers, lakes and even the ocean are blighted by raw sewage and garbage. Rower and Olympic hopeful Felipe Xavier said: 'I have to come train but these dead fish bother us because the smell is very strong and the huge amount of fish slows the boat.' But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution. In February, twaite shad died  in the blighted waters of Guanabara Bay, where the Olympic sailing events are to be held. Members of a local rowing club have to train among the dead fish in\u00a0Rodrigo de Freitas lake ahead of the Olympic Games in the city in 2016 . Rubbish collectors will continue to clear the decomposing fish, a small silvery species called twaite shad, off the water's surface in Rio . More than 37 tons of fish have been collected, according to Rio's waste management company, but there is still an overwhelming stench . The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de\u00a0Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that\u00a0the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature. 'The intense rains that happened last week and a rise in the sea levels led to a spike in the (sea) water entering the lake, causing a thermal shock,' it said in a statement, reporting that water temperature in the lake quickly fell by 4C. However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque? Rio de\u00a0Janeiro's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish, which are currently being cleared from the water . Lagoon: There are so many fish on the surface of the lake in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that almost no water can be seen in some places . Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish. Rio's water quality has become one of the most contentious issues heading into the 2016 Olympics. Authorities have long said  the games would be the catalyst for a major cleanup of the city's waterways, but as the  sporting event approaches with few improvements, they are now admitting that the Olympic promises won't be met.

Rio Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao acknowledged earlier this week 'there's not going to be time' to finish the cleanup ahead of the games, suggesting it might take until the end of 2018 instead.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nDetectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed. The 'crystal clear' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the Metropolitan Police by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene. The worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on Monday last week, believing detectives would already have similar images of the \u00a360m raid. Scroll down for video . Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed . But, even though police raced to obtain the CCTV once the report was made, the force has refused to make the images public \u2013 despite claims it is the best footage yet. It comes after the force was criticised  for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on Good Friday - four days before the raid was discovered. A veteran trader in the London \u00adjewellery quarter told The Sunday Mirror: 'It is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police. The \u00adfootage could be crucial in collaring the crooks. 'You would assume the officers had done everything to get CCTV footage.' Scotland Yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist, with the ex-head of the Flying Squad John O\u2019Connor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as 'totally incompetent'. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company had contacted the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Central Communications Command after the robbers set off the alarm  on Good Friday. But although police recorded the call, it was graded so that \u2018no police response was deemed to be required\u2019. It was not until Tuesday morning that detectives realised what had happened. When asked why the new footage had not been released, a police spokesman said the force would not discuss 'specifics' of CCTV being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal. The 'crystal clear' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain, which was released last week (pictured) Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror - 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard . They said: 'The Metropolitan Police has \u00adobtained and is examining a substantial amount of CCTV footage in relation to the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. 'This footage has come from many different places. We will not discuss the specifics of the CCTV we are examining and will release information in a timely manner for appeal purposes only. 'Police continue to seize CCTV with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses.' Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror, 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard. Mahendra Bavishi, joint director of the safe deposit company, said he was furious at police for ignoring an alarm which went off just on Good Friday . The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted' with the find. One source said the footage 'blows the case wide open'. But detectives later insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Hours earlier, police had refused to tell MailOnline whether they had the footage. The furore raised questions about why the police chose to keep the footage to themselves - or whether they even had the footage - despite it being one of the largest ever burglaries in the capital. But officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad did release images of three suspects. They refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Earlier this week, Mahendra Bavishi, the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the raid, said  he believed it was an inside job. Mr Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives had asked to put some \u2018sensitive\u2019 questions to his British-based son Manish who runs the business - including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. He added that the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. The 69-year-old also told of his fury at police for ignoring the alert from the state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were carrying out the raid. The incident took place over the Easter weekend, when the gang forced their way into 72 safe deposit boxes by sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall. It is estimated that anything from \u00a360million to \u00a3200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company\u2019s vaults in London\u2019s diamond district. Meanwhile, police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden incident and a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than \u00a38.3m, have never been found. It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London, including the use of a heavy-duty drill to bore through concrete walls, and the belief that the well-planned burglary was carried out with the help of an insider. German detectives are now keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in the robbery.",

The heist involved a sophisticated break-in over Easter weekend, with thieves stealing valuables worth an estimated \u00a360 million to \u00a3200 million. Additionally, there are potential links between this heist and a similar burglary in Berlin in 2013, suggesting possible insider knowledge and similar methods used in both crimes.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nHe has been painted by history as a wicked hunchback, but Richard III kept the disease that curved his spine secret through out his life, a historian has claimed. The last Plantagenet king of England was described by William Shakespeare as a 'poisonous bunch-back'd toad' in his play depicting the monarch. But research on the king's skeleton discovered under a council car park in Leicester revealed that this may have been an exaggeration of a spine deformity known as scoliosis. Scroll down for video . Richard III's skeleton found under a car park in Leicester was found to a distinctive scoliosisof the spine . Now a new academic paper claims that even this condition, which caused one of his shoulders to be slightly higher than the other, was probably not known about until after his death. Dr Mary Ann Lund, from the University of Leicester's school of English, said tailoring and specially fitted armour probably helped to disguise the curve in his spine. The genetic analysis showed that Richard III almost certainly had blue eyes and likely had blonde hair - although it may have darkened with age. Richard III was depicted by William Shakespeare as a tyrannical hunchback who murdered two princes in the Tower of London. But scans of the king's skeleton show he wasn't a hunchback, but only had a slight deformity that would have barely affected his appearance or prowess on the field of battle. The notorious description by Shakespeare of a \u2018hunchback toad\u2019, a Machiavellian villain suffering a twisted body, a limp and withered arm, was almost certainly an attempt to blacken his reputation, experts claim. Instead, a 3D reconstruction of the king\u2019s spine shows 65 to 85 degrees of \u2018scoliosis\u2019, or sideways bending of his spine to the right. The condition, which would have developed in his early teens, means he was very far from being a hunchback. Despite having one shoulder slightly higher than the other and a short trunk in comparison with his arms and legs, there is no evidence he walked with a limp. She said: 'It is highly likely that Richard took care to control his public image. 'The body of the king was part of the propaganda of power, and even when it was revealed in order to be anointed as part of his coronation ceremony it was simultaneously concealed from the congregation. 'Tailoring probably kept the signs of his scoliosis hidden to spectators outside the royal household of attendants, servants and medical staff who dressed, bathed and tended to the monarch's body.' Writing in the journal Medical Humanities, Dr Lund argues that like other monarchs Richard III's body image would have been carefully controlled. It was only after his death at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 that his physical shape was made public when his corpse was stripped and displayed. Dr Lund said that it was this treatment that later led to his reputation as a hunchback - something that was later picked up by Shakespeare. She said were no surviving descriptions of Richard III's distinctive physique from during his lifetime. Instead she says that his appearance became increasingly distorted through out the Tudor period. Dr Lund said: 'Stage history has reincarnated Richard as monster, villain and clown, but recent events have helped us to re-evaluate these physically defined depictions and strip back the cultural accretions that have surrounded his body. This reconstruction of Richard III, based on his skull, has revealed what the king looked like 500 years ago . Scientists studying the skull of Richard III (above) found he had suffered several brutal blows before he died . Scientists used 3D scanning to reconstruct how Richard III's (right) skeleton may have been deformed (left) 'The care he in all probability received for his scoliosis from his surgically trained physician was large in scale: traction and manual manipulation needed specially designed equipment, space and assistants. 'Yet, it may have been only a relatively small group of people in Richard's trusted circle who knew of his condition. The absence of contemporary testimony does not prove this, however. 'What is certain is that, after his death, the exposure of Richard's body went beyond the two days of its exhibition in Leicester. 'That moment after Bosworth inaugurated a longer and more brutalising process, in which an ever-more twisted physique was revealed to the public eye, his own body becoming deployed as a major tactic in the rhetorical strategy against him. The skeleton of Richard III, with the curve in his spine clearly visible, was found under a car park in Leicester . 'When Shakespeare's Richard boasts of his shape-changing potential, he registers too the bending course of history and myth making.' Analysis of Richard III's skeleton, which was discovered buried in a shallow grave at the site of Grey Friars Abbey in Leicester in 2012, showed that many depictions of the king's appearance had been exaggerated. A 3D reconstruction of his spine showed that it had 65 to 85 degrees of scoliosis - a sideways bend of his spine to the right. The condition would have developed in his early teens, but was far from being a hunchback. The scientists at the University of Leicester who examined the skeleton said there was also little evidence that the king would have walked with a limp. However, there are some that point to the alleged murder of Richard III's nephews Edward V and Richard of Shrewsbury - the so called Princes in the Tower - as evidence of the king's character. They say this act of infanticide is what earned the Plantagenet king his blackened reputation rather than his physical appearance. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king\u00a0was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.",
    "text": "Despite his portrayal by Shakespeare as a deformed and villainous hunchback, Richard III's scoliosis (a curvature of the spine) was likely a well-kept secret during his lifetime. Dr. Mary Ann Lund argues that tailoring and armor would have disguised his condition, which, while noticeable, wouldn't have caused a hunchback or limp.  \n\nDr. Lund believes Richard III carefully managed his public image, and it was only after his death at the Battle of Bosworth that his body was displayed and his scoliosis became public knowledge. This, she posits, led to the exaggerated accounts of his deformity, later perpetuated by Shakespeare. \n\nWhile Richard III's skeleton does show evidence of scoliosis, 3D reconstructions suggest it was less severe than historically depicted. Although some argue his alleged role in the \"Princes in the Tower\" case cements his villainous reputation, Dr. Lund's research challenges the traditional, physically defined image of Richard III, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of the king and his legacy.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nPoland said it is demanding a formal apology from the U.S. over the comments made by FBI director James Comey (pictured above) The US ambassador for Poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the FBI who blamed Polish people for helping the Nazis kill Jews during the Holocaust. James Coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the Washington Post claiming Poland shares responsibility for the Holocaust with Germany. The piece sparked outrage among Polish politicians and media. US Ambassador Stephen Mull met with the Polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments. He said:\u00a0'I made clear that the opinion that Poland is in any way responsible for the Holocaust is not the position of the United States. 'Nazi Germany alone bears responsibility.' Mr Mull said he now had 'a lot of work' to do to rectify the situation. Comey's April 16 opinion piece in the Washington Post\u00a0stated that Poland played a role in Nazi Germany's genocide of six million European Jews in the Holocaust. 'In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn't do something evil,' Comey wrote. The piece was titled\u00a0Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum. 'They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do,' it continues. Scroll down for video . Poland's president Bronislaw Komorowski told public television that Comey's comments showed a 'lack of historical knowledge' and were an 'insult to thousands of Poles who helped Jews'. On Sunday foreign ministry spokesman Marcin Wojciechowski wrote on Twitter that Mull would 'receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology.' US Ambassador Stephen Mull apologised to Poland . The US Ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the Polish capital on Sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Six million Polish citizens were killed under Nazi Germany's occupation of Poland during World War II. While half of the victims were Jewish, the other half were Christian. Historical records show instances of Poles turning against their Jewish neighbours, either killing them or giving them up to the Nazis. Poles also risked their lives and families to save Jews. In 2012, US President Barack Obama caused outrage in Warsaw when he labelled a World War II Nazi German facility in occupied Poland used to process Jews for extermination a 'Polish death camp'. He subsequently expressed 'regret' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term 'Polish death camp.' Poland's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former Nazi German death camps as 'Polish. It says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that Poland bore responsibility for the Holocaust.

David Duane Watson, a 46-year-old Tucson firefighter, was arrested without incident Saturday on charges he killed his ex-wife\u00a0Linda Watson, 35, in what detectives say motivated by a custody dispute over their daughter. Police say the dispute continued after Watson's murder as her mother\u00a0Marilyn Cox, 63, tried to obtain visitation rights. Three years after her daughter went missing, Cox and her neighbor\u00a0Renee Farnsworth, 53, were shot dead in the driveway of Linda Watson's home. Tragic: Police say Linda Watson, left, was killed by her ex-husband David Watson during a 2000 custody dispute over their daughter Jordynn, right. Three years later, they say Mr. Watson murdered Linda's mother Marilyn Cox, center, as she tried to gain visitation rights over the girl in 2003 . Cold case closed? Seen here upon his arrest late Saturday, David Watson has been charged in the murder of his ex-wife, ex mother-in-law and an innocent neighbor . Police said at a press conference on Saturday that Mr. Watson had been the prime suspect in the murders from the start, reports the Arizona Daily Star. Watson has been charged in all three homicides, with police cited DNA evidence. Chief Deputy Chris Nanos said sheriffs never gave up on the cases, writes Tucson News Now. 'It just goes to show you that the men and women of this department are bulldogs,' said Nanos. 'We'll keep tracking you, we'll find you and you will get punished for the crimes you do.' Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson. She was last seen by a friend who'd dropped her off following a church function. Inside the home were found Ms. Watson's pager, Bible and purse. The door to her home was found open and her blood was discovered at the scene. Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson. She was last seen by a friend who dropped her off at her Tucson home after church. Her body would not be found until 2012 . Police say David Watson had been the primary suspect since 2000, but have only now tied him to the crime with what a Sheriff's Department official said Saturday was 'DNA evidence' After her disappearance, Marilyn Cox, became intent on finding her daughter and devoted her life to the search. She--along with the girl's paternal grandfather--was granted visitation rights for her granddaughter. However, Cox said at the time that Watson obstructed those rights, so she petitioned for a review. In May 2003, with another custody battle heating up, Cox was shot dead in a drive-by shooting in the driveway of the home from which her daughter had disappeared years before. Her neighbor, Renee Farnsworth, was also killed in the shooting. Meanwhile. Linda would not officially be declared dead until 2006. Her body wouldn't be found until six years after that when remains discovered in the Arizona desert turned out to be hers. Watson was scheduled to be arraigned Sunday morning at Pima County jail where the Sheriff's Department would recommend a $ million bond, reports KGUN. Marilyn Cox (right) was fighting to exercise her visitation rights over Jordynn Watson when she and her neighbor Renee Farnsworth were gunned down in a 2003 drive-by shooting outside the very home from which Linda had disappeared three years earlier .",

His two, third-place finishes at Sandown Park in front of a packed crowd of 18,000 race fans brought an end to the greatest racing career in history. McCoy, 40, has been champion jump jockey for the past 20 years, and when he was handed the trophy for the final time today by former Arsenal player Ian Wright, it emerged that the Irish jockey will be allowed to keep it in perpetuity. An emotional Tony McCoy takes a moment after he finished third in his 17,630th race at Sandown Park . Some 18,000 people packed Sandown Park to see the 20-time Champion Jockey on his final two rides . McCoy was joined on stage by his wife Chanelle and daughter Eve and young son Archie . McCoy, known to racing fans as AP, was cheered on by his wife Chanelle, and children Archie and Eve. In a career that has lasted more than 25 years, McCoy has ridden in more than 17,000 races and fallen an estimated 1,000 times breaking almost every bone in his body at least once. McCoy looked clearly emotional has he waved to the crowd after finishing third aboard Box Office in his final race. The record-breaking jockey admitted that, unusually, he had difficulty sleeping last night before his final professional rides. McCoy has been Champion Jockey in Britain and Ireland since 1996. During his career he has had 4,348 winners since his first victory in in Thurles, in Tipperary, Ireland on March 26, 1992 aboard Legal Steps. His first British winner was in Exeter in 1994, riding Chickabiddy to victory. AP McCoy was reduced to tears as he competed as a professional jockey for the last-ever time on Saturday . An emotional McCoy couldn't contain his emotions as he waved to the crowd after his last race . McCoy was congratulated by fellow jockeys as he prepared for his final ever race after in Sandown Park . Speaking to Channel 4, McCoy said: 'Today has been way beyond my expectations and thanks to Sandown and all the people who have been here today. It\u2019s been an honour and a privilege. I\u2019ve had a brilliant way of life for the past 25 years. 'I think it\u2019s so much easier to enjoy and be successful in what you do if you like the people you work with and I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky in that respect.' After the race, he was joined on stage by his family where he addressed the crowd. 'I would like to thank the BHA for allowing me to keep the trophy. I have had it a long time. 'I don't think I will ever celebrate retirement. I feel more sadness but I aware it had to happen It felt very different driving in and going into the Weighing Room. 'I went into the sauna for three-quarters of an hour and I will probably never go into one in my life again. 'There has been the last time this and the last time that over the last few weeks but this really is the last time. Last night was probably the first time in my life I didn't sleep well. My routine is going to have to change so much I will have to adapt.' McCoy announced his retirement in February but it was only the passing of the Grand National and his last rides at Cheltenham that made reality hit home. The racing legend was swamped by photographers and punters following his last professional race . McCoy was presented the Champion Jockey trophy by Ian Wright - McCoy is an Arsenal fanatic . McCoy added: 'Race riding has been an addiction. The reason in the last two weeks I have not been riding as much was because I wanted to get myself prepared. 'That is why I announced my retirement when I did. I wanted to prepare myself for not being a jockey. 'I thought that was the best way of coping with it. It has been easy until the last couple of weeks. I am well aware the next two days , two weeks, two months, two years are going to be the most difficult.' 'I have been very lucky and what I would say to the young lads in the weighing room enjoy every moment of it. 'In any sport to be successful you have to be prepared to work harder than anyone else. I think I have got talent but I have never thought I am the best at anything. When I look back I don't think I leave much behind.' In his final race, he was beaten by his long-time rival and friend Richard Johnson - who has been runner-up in the Champion Jockey race to McCoy for the past fifteen years. Speaking after the race, McCoy tipped his friend to take over from him next season. 'I\u2019d like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey because he made me achieve a lot of the things that I did. 'I would never have achieved the numbers I have done if it wasn\u2019t for Richard Johnson. That\u2019s no disrespect to Sam Twiston-Davies or Tom Scudamore or Jason Maguire. We have numerous lads who could be Champion Jockey, but personally I would like Richard Johnson to be Champion Jockey.' In advance of his final rides today, stars from across sport, entertainment and racing paid tribute to McCoy, among them, Arsene Wenger, manager of his beloved Arsenal. The Arsenal boss said: 'I would like to congratulate you AP on your outstanding career. It\u2019s absolutely exceptional what you have done and at Arsenal, who we know you support, we are inspired by that kind of dedication, quality and consistency that you have achieved in your career. Well done.' Presenter Clare Balding said: 'I admire him so much for his skill in the saddle, for his dedication to the sport, for being able to stay at the top of his game for 20 years. 'But I almost admire him more for turning away now, for being able to bow out at the top, I think that takes so much courage. He knows he could carry on for another five years but he doesn\u2019t want to doubt himself. 'He knows that if he doubts himself for a second that will travel down the reigns and the horses won\u2019t believe what he\u2019s always believed, that he is the best.' Sandown Park was packed with fans eager to watch McCoy in his penultimate race on Saturday . The retiring 20-time champion jockey admitted he went into the final two rides of his career with a heavy heart . Retiring jockey McCoy insists he will never return to professional racing after his Sandown farewell . Dame Judi Dench, Actress: 'A winner. He\u2019s a winner. I can\u2019t imagine how he is going to feel, I must say, retiring from having such a kind of glittering career. He was born to ride a horse, he was born to win too. It\u2019s wonderful to meet him and be able to say to him, you\u2019re a legend.' Ian Wright, who presented the Champions Jockey trophy McCoy said: 'AP McCoy is made of something else altogether. For 20 years he has been at the top of his game, riding winners, week in week out. I can think of no other sportsman or woman who can match his record. Like the Arsenal team of 2003/04 he\u2019s proven that he truly is an Invincible. It was an incredible honour to award him with his trophy for the final time on the day he retires.' Trainer Jonjo O\u2019Neill, who : 'He\u2019s a brilliant all-rounder. He was the one man out there you didn\u2019t want riding against you. I was lucky to get a lot of use out of him \u2013 more than anybody else. He\u2019s fantastic on the lesser horses and he gets just as much of a kick out of winning a selling plate race as he does the Gold Cup. He gives it the same ride, that\u2019s why he\u2019s very special.' JP McManus, Racehorse Owner and long-standing employer: 'I get enormous pleasure from AP riding. If he is on one of my horses then it\u2019s a bonus but if it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s I still get a thrill out of it. We\u2019ve had many great days winning the Grand National and a Gold Cup. There\u2019s never a right time [to retire], but it\u2019s nice that he\u2019s picking a time of his choosing. He\u2019s an ironman and a lovely man. I\u2019ve grown to love him more and more, as my family have. There\u2019s something deep and great about him.' Tony McCoy signs autographs for punters on his final-ever day as a jockey at Sandown .

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nThe Mail is asking you to nominate mothers who have created businesses from scratch, while also caring for their children, for our first ever Mumpreneur Of The Year Award, in association with NatWest everywoman Awards. Today\u2019s nominee is Petra Wetzel, 40, a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine. She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006... Listening to the Italian businessman on the other end of the line, Petra could see pound signs in front of her eyes. He had heard about the huge popularity of Petra\u2019s bottled beer. Now he wanted to meet to discuss importing it in bulk to Italy. It was a fantastic opportunity. But, as she consulted her diary, Petra \u2014 who runs one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries, knew what her answer had to be. Petra Wetzel, 40 (pictured), is a divorcee who lives in Glasgow with her son, Noah, nine (pictured). She set up her own business, the WEST brewery, in 2006 . \u2018He could only offer me a two-hour slot bang in the middle of my son\u2019s sports day last year,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018I had to say No. I\u2019m a businesswoman, but I\u2019m a mum first.\u2019 Blonde, attractive and the founder of one of Britain\u2019s most successful small breweries with an annual turnover just shy of \u00a310 million, Petra may well be every man\u2019s dream. But she says with a laugh: \u2018I sound like a real catch. But the truth is I\u2019m fiercely independent, stubborn and work long hours. The only man in my life is Noah. He\u2019s my priority and the reason I drive myself so hard.\u2019 As a single mother, running a hugely successful business is a tall order. What makes Petra\u2019s success even more extraordinary is that she started her company when Noah was just a baby \u2014 and in the wake of a broken marriage. Petra\u2019s flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is stocked in 100 branches of Waitrose in the UK as well as in branches of Tesco in Scotland. And later this year she is opening a second brewery in Glasgow to cope with demand. The germ of the idea came in 1994 when Petra, who was born in Germany, was having a drink with her father, Herbert, in a pub. \u2018I was studying at Glasgow University and Dad had come to visit,\u2019 she recalls. Petra (pictured) was inspired to start her own brewery when her father visited her Glasgow and she realised that the city didn't have its own brewery . He ordered a pint of local lager, took a sip and winced. Then he asked what the best Glasgow lager was and, to my horror, I realised I didn\u2019t know. \u2018In Germany, every village and town has a good brewery. It\u2019s something people are proud of and want to show off to visitors. He couldn\u2019t believe that a city like Glasgow didn\u2019t have its own brewery. It got me thinking.\u2019 Twelve years later, Petra opened a small brewery and beer hall/restaurant with her then husband, Gordon, with the help of a loan from her parents. \u2018I met Gordon at university and married him in December 2000,\u2019 recalls Petra. \u2018We both had first-class business degrees and, naively, I thought that meant we could easily run a business. I was working as a lawyer, so we agreed Gordon would take charge and I would take a back seat.\u2019 WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Noah was born. \u2018He was conceived on a trip to Chicago, where we\u2019d gone to learn about brewing,\u2019 Petra recalls. \u2018I had been told that I could never have children so, although the timing was terrible because of the new business, we were both ecstatic.\u2019 She adds: \u2018We had bills to pay, so I was working three days a week just two months after Noah arrived. With my legal job and a newborn, I didn\u2019t have time to think about the business. Besides, I thought it was in safe hands.\u2019 The WEST Brewing Company opened in March 2006, just eight months after Petra's son, Noah was born. She initially started the company with Gordan, her then husband . However, in October 2006, when Noah was just three months old, Petra\u2019s life went into free fall when her marriage fell apart. \u2018I was so devastated, I decided to step away from the business. I focused on looking after Noah and my job.\u2019 However, in December 2007, a little over a year after the break-up of their marriage, Petra had another shock: the business was in crisis. \u2018Gordon was away when the butcher who supplied our restaurant rang and threatened to set fire to my car,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018It turned out the company owed him thousands. \u2018When I went round to the company\u2019s office. I filled a black bin liner with our unpaid invoices, went home and spent the night going over them. We had debts up to our eyeballs.\u2019 Many women would have quit. But looking at her son, Petra realised she didn\u2019t have a choice. \u2018It was sink or swim. Noah gave me the confidence I needed,\u2019 says Petra. \u2018We had ploughed my inheritance into the business. It was all I had. Besides, I knew I\u2019d hit on a great idea. All it needed was graft to make it work. My parents agreed to look after Noah for seven weeks in Germany. The company went into administration. I called in a brilliant firm of accountants and worked flat out on a plan for the future. Petra (pictured with Noah) says her son gave her the confidence she needed to carry on with the business even after the initial struggles . \u2018It was tough. Noah went into full-time day care and most nights I would still be at my laptop at 1am. Many times, I sobbed myself to sleep. I felt way out of my depth, but I became good at multi-tasking. \u2018I quit my legal job and bought the assets out of the hands of administrators and began building it, single-handedly, into the thriving company it is today. We are now a beer brand as well as a restaurant and beer hall. And our flagship beer, St Mungo lager, is sold worldwide. We are just about to send a consignment to Hong Kong. Of course, I have to make tough choices. I could beat myself up about not being there enough for Noah. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times he will be in the car and I have to shush him because I\u2019m taking an important call. \u2018But feeling guilty is just a waste of energy. Noah knows he\u2019s my priority. We are a very tight unit \u2014 particularly as his father now lives in America. We have the most wonderful full-time nanny, Helen, who Noah adores, and I spend every second I\u2019m not working with him. \u2018Recently he said: \u201cMum you are a brilliant Mum and a brilliant Dad.\u201d That meant the world to me. \u2018And thanks to the business, we have a great lifestyle. For my 40th birthday I bought us a treat: a speedboat. It\u2019s moored at Loch Lomond and zipping up and down the water at weekends makes a tough working week worthwhile.\u2019",

Speaking on Sky Sports' The Fantasy Football Club, Redknapp said: 'I went to Arsenal and to be honest with you they were fantastic. 'The people you meet, everyone, I signed autographs and spoke with everybody. I come out and had a couple of pictures in my car with the lads who come over - they were Arsenal fans.

They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused:\u00a0Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that\u2019s not where a large portion of the investors\u2019 money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.",

Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, 32, used company credit cards to pay for her \u00a310,000 wedding, as well as a \u00a35,000 honeymoon in the Seychelles. She was arrested at Heathrow when she returned from the honeymoon - but now she has been spared jail even though a court heard that she had been convicted of fraud twice previously. Just married: But Gabrielle Yinka Saunders, pictured during her wedding to David Osborne, stole \u00a317,000 to pay for the ceremony and her luxury honeymoon . Fraud: Saunders, pictured outside the Old Bailey, admitted cheating her company out of thousands of pounds . Saunders, also known as Gabriella Osborne since getting married at Belair House in Dulwich last September, stole \u00a335,000 from her previous employer PriceWaterhouseCoopers, where she worked as a tax accountant. After serving a jail sentence, she started a \u00a340,000-a-year job as a personal assistant at Insight Investments in June last year. But she proceeded to embezzle a total of \u00a317,000 using her colleagues' credit cards - including \u00a3600 for flowers, \u00a3270 on a new watch, \u00a3210 on a new outfit and \u00a3400 for a mobile phone. The Old Bailey heard Saunders came to the UK from Nigeria and graduated from Southampton University with a law degree in 2004, before starting work at PwC. While working at the multinational firm, Saunders forged taxi receipts to destinations across the country at up to \u00a3250 a time, then signed them off by faking a colleague's signature. Couple: Saunders was convicted of fraud twice before her latest offence . Free: Saunders, pictured with her husband in an engagement photo, was spared jail . Celebration: But Saunders was arrested at Heathrow when the couple returned from their honeymoon . In 2007 she was jailed for six months for fraud, and in 2011 she was again convicted of fraud but spared jail after a court heard she had stolen money from neighbour using credit cards. The day after Saunders started working at Insight Investments in June, she charged \u00a35,272 to a colleague's credit card in order to pay travel agent Trailfinders for her luxury honeymoon with husband David Osborne. Mugshot: Saunders pictured after she was jailed for a \u00a335,000 fraud in 2007 . In September she used another colleague's card to pay \u00a310,254 to Belair House, \u00a3268.20 to the jeweller Andrew Charles, \u00a3597 to PESH flowers, \u00a3208.44 to fashion store ASOS and \u00a3390 to EE T-mobile. Prosecutor Roger Daniells-Smith said: 'She paid for a prestige wedding venue, she paid for the flowers, she paid for her honeymoon outfit and clothing. 'She paid for phone calls to make these arrangements and she paid for the gift of a watch. She paid for the honeymoon which was a first-class trip to Dubai and then on to the Seychelles. 'They were arrested at Heathrow when they returned to the UK and she made no comment in interview, but it was clear from the evidence that she was solely responsible for these frauds.' Saunders, from Camberwell in south London, admitted seven counts of fraud totalling \u00a316,990, and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment suspended for two years, with 200 hours of unpaid work. Judge Stephen Gullick decided against jailing her after he was told that she had repaid the money and was retraining as a teacher. He said: 'You have a singularly unimpressive record and you have already served a prison sentence some time ago. Pricey: Saunders spent \u00a310,000 of her firm's money to book Belair House for her wedding reception . Honeymoon: She also stole \u00a35,000 to pay for a luxury post-wedding break in the Seychelles . 'You did not disclose your previous dishonesty to your employers, who were prepared to take you on as an administrative assistant on a good salary. 'The fact is within days you were prepared to take advantage. You effectively defrauded others to the tune of \u00a317,000, all of which has been paid back. That money was used to finance your wedding and the subsequent honeymoon. 'You have now started working in a completely different environment. I hope they will never place you in a position of trust with anything to do with money. 'These were serious offences but it appears you are turning your life around. If you continue to commit offences of dishonest of this nature you will eventually receive a very long sentence of imprisonment indeed.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nSometimes life imitates art, but apparently not when it comes to the Central Intelligence Agency. Current and former female agents spoke out to the New York Times on Sunday to renounce depictions of CIA women on TV shows and in movies. The group of women say they are nothing like the honey-pots on these shows who use their sexuality to ensnare terrorists and drown PTSD with booze and pills. Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes, 69, who helped expose her colleague Aldrich Ames as a Russian double agent, says she sees nothing of herself in the characters at the center of shows like State of Affairs and Homeland. 'I wish they wouldn\u2019t use centerfold models in tight clothes. We don\u2019t look that way. And we don\u2019t act that way,' Grimes told the Times. Scroll down for video . That's not me: Retired CIA officer Sandra Grimes (pictured above in January 2013) \u00a0is one of many former and current women at the agency speaking out about depictions of female spies on TV and in movies . Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett, one of the 'Band of Sisters' who helped track down Osama bin Laden, has the most trouble with how her fallen co-worker Jennifer Matthews was portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty. In the scenes before her death in a terrorist attack on a U.S. military base in Afghanistan, actress Jennifer Ehle plays Matthews as a 'giddy' agent, excitedly baking a Jordanian source a cake for their meeting on his birthday. As in real life, Matthews dies as the agent gets out of his car and detonates a suicide vest. 'The problem is that they portray most women in such a one-dimensional way; whatever the character flaw is, that\u2019s all they are,' Bennett said.\u00a0'It can leave a very distinct understanding of women at the agency - how we function, how we relate to men, how we engage in national security - that is pretty off.' One of the fictional CIA agents currently on screen is Charlie Tucker on NBC's State of Affairs. Played by Katherine Heigl, Charlie is a character who in the first episode gets drunk at a bar, sleeps with a stranger and lashes out at her psychiatrist. Another example is Homeland's Carrie Mathison (played by Claire Danes) - a bi-polar spy who gives up nearly all responsibility for her child (the product of a secret relationship with a double agent) and spends most of her time controlling sources with sex. A retired covert officer identified as Meredith says sex isn't a major part of the spy game. Offensive: Veteran CIA analyst Gina Bennett says she was upset with the 'giddy' portrayal of her friend Jennifer Matthews (left) in the movie Zero Dark Thirty (played by Jennifer Ehle, right). Matthews, in real life as in the movie, was killed by a suicide bomber at an Afghanistan military base in 2009 . 'Let\u2019s not kid ourselves. For me, working in the Middle East, there\u2019s a lot of attraction for Middle Eastern men for Western women. I don\u2019t mean necessarily sexually...but curiosity, if nothing else. And we certainly have played that.' However, Meredith says she more often has to put men in their place while doing her work. 'You need to remove [sex] off the table very quickly and clearly. Sometimes it\u2019s \"Get your hands off my knee or I\u2019m going to break it,\" or you put as many people into the room as you can,' she said. While the trials and tribulations of female agents on screen are wildly exaggerated, the women interviewed said they do similarly struggle to maintain the balance between their work and private lives. It's not about sex: The real women of the CIA say they are not all honey-pots who use their sexuality to control sources (like Carrie Mathison on Showtime's Homeland, played by Claire Danes above) Sending the wrong message: The women also take issue with NBC show State of Affairs, which features Katherine Heigl (above) as a troubled CIA analyst . 'I briefed Condoleezza Rice while in labor. I\u2019d tell her about the global jihad and then I would turn away and breathe. When these two worlds clash, they clash really hard,' Bennett said. Bennett says that the concerns of her job are so important, that it's hard to come home and sympathize with the minor dramas ruling her teenager's life. 'I deal with people who are trying to kill lots of people in horrendous, painful ways. So I have a wall; it\u2019s really tall. Unfortunately, though, what happens with time is you can\u2019t click it on or off. You just block the sensation of feeling,' Bennett said. 'I\u2019m no longer married because of my wall. So I have five kids whose parents aren\u2019t together because I constructed that wall over time and didn\u2019t know how to get through it,' Bennett added. Many of the women though said they enjoyed working for the agency, which is becoming more and more female friendly with a day care center in Langley and flexible time off. Which is good because Bennett thinks women naturally make great agents. 'Women don\u2019t think more intuitively than men, but we tend to trust our own gut less. We are not going to put all our money in one basket,' she said.",
    "text": "Summary:\n\nCurrent and former female CIA agents have spoken out against the portrayal of women in spy-themed TV shows and movies. They argue that these depictions are unrealistic and one-dimensional, often focusing on sexuality and personal struggles rather than their actual work. The women emphasize that their jobs do not revolve around using sex to manipulate sources, and they take issue with the glamorized appearances of fictional agents.\n\nWhile the real agents acknowledge that balancing work and personal life can be challenging, they stress that their experiences are vastly different from what is shown on screen. They highlight the growing female-friendly environment at the CIA and the natural aptitude women have for intelligence work.\n\nThe article contrasts the fictional portrayals in shows like \"Homeland\" and \"State of Affairs\" with the experiences of actual CIA officers, who describe their work as more nuanced and professional than what is depicted in popular media.",

Long drop: The child dangles from the residential block in\u00a0the Xiangtan District, south China . Propped up: A neighbour stops the five-year-old from suffocating by giving her a poll to sit on . Neighbours rushed to help after they spotted the little girl hanging in the air with her head trapped between the bars. Some used a piece of pipe to prop her up and prevent her from suffocating, while others supported her feet before firemen eventually arrived - half an hour later. One neighbour told local TV: 'Her terrified screams alerted us and we saw that the upper half of her body was lodged between the security bars and she was slowly slipping down. Rescue: A fireman helps the little girl who has fallen between the metal bars and become trapped by her neck . 'So a bunch of us leapt to action to try save her. We grabbed a drainpipe section and used that to prop her up. And we were talking to her, telling her not to panic.' Another woman took a handful of blankets from her home and laid them on the road below in case the girl fell. People have taken to Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, to praise the tireless efforts of the neighbour below, who supported her feet the entire time. They coined the term 'lifting man' in reference to him, which has now become internet slang for anyone who does a good deed. Help: The good Samaritan supports the child's legs while a worried crowd gathers below the apartment block . Slow response: People took to Weibo to praise neighbours and criticise the emergency services for taking 30 minutes to reach the girl, whose rescue was covered by local TV . \u2018Nice people are still around,\u2019 commented online user \u2018Baby Lexuan\u2019.

Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway production Finding Neverland in New York City. The play, which stars Glee star Matthew Morrison and Kelsey Grammer, is based on the 2004 film of the same name Weinstein produced starring Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp. The couple have been out together numerous times over the past few weeks as well, attending Finding Neverland rehearsals, celebrating Easter together with their children, and at a party for Georgina\u2019s birthday earlier in the week. Scroll down for video . Harvey Weinsten and his designer wife Georgina Chapman (above) turned up for the premiere of his new Broadway play Finding Neverland on Wednesday . Composer Gary Barlow, actor Matthew Morrison,  Weinstein, actress Laura Michelle Kelly and actor Kelsey Grammer at the premiere . The happy couple were joined by stars including Helen Mirren, Bryan Cranston, Ansel Elgort, Darren Criss, Olivia Wilde and Christoph Waltz for the opening night of the play, which received disastrous reviews from critics. New York Magazine called the show 'badly written' and 'frustrating,' while the New York Times\u00a0said the production is 'largely made up of empty calories.' Ambra Battilana (above) claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March . Earlier this week Chapman shared a photo of the birthday flowers (above) Weinstein sent her . And while Weinstein may not be thrilled with these reviews, he is not doubt happy with the news that he will not be facing criminal charges for last month's groping incident. District attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero said last Friday: 'This case was taken seriously from the outset, with a thorough investigation conducted by our Sex Crimes Unit. 'After analyzing the available evidence, including multiple interviews with both parties, a criminal charge is not supported.' Ambra Battilana claimed Weinstein stuck his hand under her skirt during a meeting at his office in March. Olivia Wilde (left) and Georgina Chapman (right) attend The Opening Night performance of Finding Neverland on Broadway at The Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Wednesday night in New York City . The model, 22, also claimed Weinstein asked if her boobs were real. Weinstein reportedly cooperated with police throughout their investigation. The perfectly polished Chapman, 38, and notoriously brash Weinstein, 63, began dating in late 2004 and were married three years later at their Connecticut estate. The wedding, in which the British beauty wore one of her own Marchesa designs, was packed with celebrities, including Cameron Diaz, Renee Zellweger, Naomi Watts, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez and Vogue editrix Anna Wintour, to name just a few. They welcomed daughter India in 2010 and son Dashiell three years later. Weinstein and Chapman were last photographed together at this year's Academy Awards (above)",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nIt has long been considered the most expensive place in the UK to buy property, but it seems London is being pipped to the post by coastal Salcombe. According to data, analysed by Harbour Hotels, the average cost of property in London - a whopping \u00a3638,217 - actually falls below that of the Devon enclave. The seaside town in the South Hams district boasts a skyrocketing average property price: \u00a3671,759. According to new data, the average cost of property in Salcombe, Devon, now tops the average cost in London . This is more then the average cost of property in some of the UK's most expensive cities, including Oxford, Bath and Edinburgh. And for those who want a room with a water view, that will cost you even more. The average value of a waterfront property in Salcombe tops \u00a32million, putting it ahead of some of London's priciest postcodes, including Notting Hill and Regent's Park. In the west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, prices average \u00a31,629,495, while Regent's Park comes in with an average property value of \u00a31,338,467 and Hampstead Heath close behind at \u00a31,270,274. In the pricey west London neighbourhood of Notting Hill, property prices average \u00a31,629,465 . Regent's Park comes in with an average cost of \u00a31,338,467 and Hampstead Heath (pictured) at\u00a0\u00a31,270,274 . In Salcombe, property facing the estuary cost as high as \u00a32 million, with non-sea views tallying \u00a3671,759 . Salcombe made headlines last spring when it was named Britain's most expensive seaside resort. Since then, property prices have continued to soar, increasing ten per cent in the last 12 months alone, which puts Salcombe's property market on par with London's 11 per cent yearly increase.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nEvidence has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of Russian bullion, supposedly bound for America, being lost in the river Clyde. The gold and silver bars had been loaded in Murmansk onto a former Irish Sea ferry, converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped to take part in a dangerous Arctic convoy. The bullion was to pay the Americans for arms shipped to Russia during one of the most crucial stages of the Second World War. Scroll down for video . The bullion was loaded onto the HMS Ulster Queen (pictured) in 1942 and was being transferred to the U.S. as payment for weapons when the case of precious metals was lost overboard . The former ferry, HMS Ulster Queen, arrived in Greenock in November 1942, after 13 days at sea and two ships sunk by German U-boats. But as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat, one slipped and fell into the muddy waters. Such a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recovered. In fact, the incident has only come to light thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the Ulster Queen's engineers, and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Murmansk and Archangel in Russia's extreme northwest. Mr Thomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his pre-war role as a crewman on the research ship RRS Discovery II in the Southern Ocean. He had joined the Discovery as a 17-year-old in his native Portsmouth. He continued his writings on the Convoys - but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble, he wrote in code and secreted them well. Before he died in 2000, aged 88, he transcribed some of them into four A4 journals, which his daughter, Leona Thomas, has now edited into a book. Edinburgh man Leonard H. Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from Russia's extreme northwest . Leona, 61, a retired school teacher, said yesterday: 'The story about the Russian bullion is fascinating. It must be documented somewhere, but I have never been able to find out what happened afterwards.' According to her father's notes, there had been 'a peculiar silence all through the ship' as she was loaded in Russia. No one was allowed on deck, no one was allowed along the alleyways forward of the engine room, and no one off the mess decks unless they were on watch. Mr Thomas recorded: 'No scuttles [were] allowed to be opened, but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers, up and down the cleared area of the track, hundreds of them, all with rifles and many with Tommy guns. 'Our guards lined the deck, we later heard, either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [mine detectors]. A huge, dark wagon was coaxed, nudged, and jogged until the derrick's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground. 'Officers approached the wagon and examined locks and bolts [with] armed troops literally surrounding it. Then began the laborious manual exercise of [unloading] what looked like ammunition boxes, which required two men to lift. 'Surely this wasn't small arms ammunition! Not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us. It certainly was not. It was bullion! 'Two boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went, deposited on our deck, from where each one was slid and lowered down into the 'B Gun' magazine, never out of sight of at least one officer. 'This was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the USA to arm the Russians.' 'Then into the Wardroom [went the] harassed officials, who, we heard, lashed into the whisky \"as if it were free.\" Probably, with all that off their hands, they could afford to.' Once back in the Clyde, after 'a fast run down the Minches', calamity was to come, however. Mr Thomas wrote: 'It was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the Boom Control vessels, hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture, and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighter. 'For the next hour it was cloak-and-dagger stuff again, no one allowed on the upper deck forward of the Wardroom or on the working alleyways. We heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been man-handled onto the upper deck. 'The paravane derrick was reeved [threaded] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch. The first two boxes were slung with a hemp rope-sling. Mr Thomas, who died in 2000 aged 88, pictured with his late wife Louie in 1996 . 'In the shaded lights were many officials, officers, men in good suits, bayonets, torches, clipboards, tarpaulins, surreptitious smokers, but nary an onlooker. 'Our Captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge, his nose barely over the canvas dodger, to observe the last rites of the Russian bullion. 'And then it happened. The first boxes, two in number, were being hauled toward the lighter, and who knows what happened, but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the Clyde. 'I was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a H. M. Bateman cartoon. Needless to say, all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair. 'The rest was capably transferred to a lighter, various bits of paper signed, exchanged, and pocketed, and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clear.' Written in the diaries left for his daughter, Mr Thomas said: 'I was thankful to keep all these years, the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times I found myself in, especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger, both man-made and that of nature.' Leona said of the gold: 'Who knows, it may still be there.' Mr Thomas wrote in his diary how the crew of the Ulster Queen had hoped their ship would be chosen to steam straight for America, so they could 'live it up' for a few days before returning to war-torn Europe. In the end, the decision was apparently made to off-load the cargo in the Clyde, for eventual transfer to another vessel for the Atlantic crossing. The HMS Ulster Queen pictured in her pre-war days as an Irish Sea ferry. She was later converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped .",

Soil underneath a slide at the park in the Toshima ward in the north-east of the Japanese capital, showed radiation readings of up to 480 microsieverts per hour. This is nearly half the recommended annual limit of exposure for a person. Danger: Japanese authorities detected an unusually high level of radiation around playground equipment in this Tokyo park (pictured) Safety: Authorities cordoned off the park after high levels of radiation were detected underneath a slide . It was not immediately clear why radiation levels were so high in the park, which opened two years after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Authorities believe that the radiation could be coming from something buried underneath the park. The playground has now been fenced off with an orange barricade. Park representative Kyoko Tsujimura said: 'We are still checking what caused these elevated radiation levels and what type of radioactive substance it is.' The city has set up a health advice office to answer queries from concerned parents. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommendations, members of the public should not be exposed to more than 1000 microsieverts per year. Japan has seen heightened concern over radiation since the 2011 failure of a nuclear plant in Fukushima following an earthquake and tsunami, which led to leaks of radioactive water. In the months after the nuclear meltdowns, concerned parents and citizens began measuring radiation levels in Tokyo schools and parks. Thousands of people are still living in temporary shelters and have been unable to return home in areas closest to Tokyo Electric Power's nuclear plant. Elsewhere, a drone with a small amount of radiation was found on Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office building this week. Clean up: Workers carry away a container after extremely high levels of radiation were detected in the park . Tests: Following two rounds of testing, officials found high levels of radiation on a section of the equipment .",

The boxer invited compatriot Adrien Broner for a feast at his mansion, as he continues his preparation for the $300million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao. Broner, a three-time world champion, took to Instagram\u00a0to show off the food on show. Floyd Mayweather is willing to splash the cash in the food department by paying over $1,000 per dish . Chef Q, also known as Quiana Jeffries, has helped the 38-year-old with his strict organic food diet . Adrien Broner posted this photo of the feast on offer as he labelled Mayweather as his 'big bro' Chef Q has been cooking for Floyd Mayweather since his fight for Manny Pacquaio was announced . BBQ chicken was on offer as she cooked one of her famous southern dishes . Cajun tilapia is a very spicy fish dish and another one of Chef Q's specialities from the south . Mayweather faces Manny Pacquiao at the MGM in Las Vegas in the biggest fight in boxing history . Quiana Jefferies, born in LA but had a grandmother from Louisiana who taught her how to cook southern dishes. Graduated from the Culinary Arts Le Cordon Bleu in Pasadena,  was part of the reality show Guy's Grocery Games by restaurateur Guy Fieri and then cooked for celebrity life coach Tony Gaskins. He said: 'Came to big bro@floydmayweather house to get a great meal from @chefism' Chef Q was also keen to show off her work and posted a video captioned: 'This is why I'm called the #KitchenBeast No it's not #Thanksgiving but it feels like it @floydmayweather wanted all this so I gave it to him #1000plate #2000plate #AddUP #BeInspired #BBQChicken #CajunTilapia #Potatoes #Mac\u00a0#CandyYams #RedBeans and #Rice #BraisedCabbage #GrilledBroccoli #CheckMate #Oprah #TMT.' His personal cook was born in LA but was taught to make southern delicacies - as seen in the video - and labels herself as the 'kitchen beast,' who also cooks to TV legend Oprah Winfrey. Jeffries, is keen to show off her friendship and partnership with the undefeated fighter, with a series of Instagram\u00a0posts showing her followers all the dishes that she cooks for him. Potatoes and vegetables are also an important part of Mayweather's fight preparation diet . Red beans and rice were cooked by the pan load as both boxers feasted on the expensive dishes . This steak dished was cooked by Chef Q and would have cost the boxer $1,000 per plate . Fried turkey dogs are another specialty southern dish of Chef Q's that Mayweather loves to indulge on . 'Holy Molly is that #Steak...Now you know why it's a #1000plate #CheckMate #BARS #AboutLastNight @floydmayweather #Oprah #CallMe #BeInspired,' she added to one caption. With the fight just eight days away, Mayweather was obviously keen to get as much protein in his system as possible and was happy to pay thousands of dollars for the dishes. The fight is at the welterweight limit of 66.7 kg, with the 38-year-old adopting an all-organic diet to be in the best shape of his life. Adrien Broner and Mayweather are known to be close friends with both training at the same gym . With the fight tickets selling out in under 60 seconds, it's poised to be one of the most memorable and iconic clashes in the history of sport. The MGM Arena in Las Vegas is the chosen venue, where 'Money' knows if he wins, then he would have created a legacy like no other. Keen boxing fan, Gordon Ramsay is another chef who seems to be reaping the benefits of Mayweather's big appetite - with the prospect of a ringside seat available in exchange for a meal. 'Money' told World Boxing News: \u00a0'I can sort that out for him, not a problem. If Gordon wants ringside tickets, then Gordon has ringside tickets. 'All I want in return, after I win the fight, is to go a little way down the strip to his grill at Caesars Palace and have the best chef in the world cook me up chicken wings, a burger and cheesecake.' English chef Gordon Ramsay has been offered ringside seats in exchange for cooking a post-match meal . Disappointed by his decision to take his diet to the next level, Las Vegas-based restaurant Fatburger created their very organic 'Floyd Burger'  to keep their favourite customer happy. Owner Darin Feinstein told TMZ: 'The meat is from the Sunfed ranch, highest quality beef. The lettuce, tomato, onion, relish, even the special sauce is all organic.' The boxer made headlines inside the establishment back in May 2014, when he was involved in a huge brawl with rapper T.I. The Filipino has been training hard with his coach Freddie Roach ahead of the $300million mega-fight . With his undefeated record on the line, Mayweather appears to be taking this fight more seriously than others .",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nWayne Rooney believes Manchester United team-mate Marouane Fellaini has gone from Old Trafford scapegoat to one of the most dangerous forwards in Europe. Fellaini was one of the stars of United's Manchester derby demolition of neighbours City on Sunday and was recently described as almost undroppable by manager Louis van Gaal. Now Rooney has revealed his admiration for the former Everton forward, saying: 'He is getting used in the right way. He is a handful for defenders to mark. Marouane Fellaini has enjoyed an upturn in fortunes in recent week at Manchester United . 'We like to play out from the back and if teams are pressing us then we have him as an option. 'He is probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down and getting us out of that pressure and further up the pitch. He is being used in the right way by the manager and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.' Fellaini was signed from Everton by Van Gaal's predecessor David Moyes in the summer of 2013 but endured a terrible first season as he suffered with injuries and tried and failed to establish himself as a holding midfield player. Wayne Rooney hailed his Belgian team-mate as one of the best in world football at the moment . Fellaini has proved a handful for defences and was instrumental in wins over Manchester City and Liverpool . Now the Belgian has emerged as a potent attacking weapon under Van Gaal, used as a second striker behind Rooney. On Sunday, City couldn't cope with him just as Liverpool had suffered at his hands at Anfield three weeks earlier. 'Last year was awful for him but in fairness he kept his head down worked hard and come through that tough period,' reflected Rooney. 'He is showing now what he did at Everton and why Manchester United bought him. 'He is a quality player. He is a different option for us. It is starting to show on the pitch. 'It was tough for him but he had the whole team's support. We knew he was working hard and it wasn't just him struggling last season a lot of us were. 'He was the one who took most of the blame for it. It was hard for him. Thankfully the manager has shown faith in him. 'He is big and he is strong and always a goal threat which he is showing now. He is awkward to mark. It is great for him and we hope it continues.' Fellaini wheels away after heading in at the far post to beat Joe Hart and give United the lead in the derby . United are now in third place in the Barclays Premier League after six league wins in a row. This weekend they travel to Chelsea with renewed hope. 'We said earlier on in the season that we were working on things and it was going to take time,' added Rooney. 'It is starting to show now, the training we have been putting in. 'We have been working really hard. 'Each game is different and we have been training for each game in a different way depending on how the opposition plays. There is no detail left unturned. We have been prepared really well.' 'We are confident going to Chelsea. 'We are in a good run of form and have beaten some good teams. It is a big test for us at Chelsea. Louis van Gaal suggested that Fellaini is almost undroppable at the moment and hailed his rebirth . 'They are top of the league and it is always tough at Stamford Bridge. They are in a very commanding position. We just have to try and win our games and finish as high as we can. 'We are still a work in progress. We are still learning. It is great how things are going and the performances we are putting in but it is has to continue. 'There is more space in the bigger games out those kinds of teams like to attack. We felt against City we could capitalise on it. We have found it tougher when teams have sat back and defended.'",

Once struggling with injuries and form, Fellaini is now seen as a potent attacking threat and has been instrumental in recent victories against Manchester City and Liverpool. Rooney admires Fellaini's ability to relieve pressure by controlling the ball and moving it up the field, describing him as one of the best in the world in that role. Fellaini's improved performances have contributed to United's current six-game winning streak, placing them third in the Premier League. As they prepare to face Chelsea, Rooney emphasizes the team's hard work and adaptability, while acknowledging that they are still a work in progress.",

When news of the suicide broke, actor and comedian, Ray Romano, 57,\u00a0who worked with Sawyer for nine years starting from when he was just a 16-month-old baby, said he was 'terribly saddened, by the news'. He added: 'He was a wonderful and sweet kid to be around. Just a great energy whenever he was there. My heart breaks for him, his family, and his friends during this very difficult time.' Sawyer appeared in 139 episodes of the popular US sitcom and also took small parts in television shows Even Stevens and Frank McKlusky C.I alongside his twin brother Sullivan in the early 2000s. The teenager played Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, while his twin brother played Michael. Their older sister Madylin also played their older sibling on the show, Ally. 'This morning a terrible family tragedy has occurred. We are devastated to report that our beloved brother, son, and friend, Sawyer Sweeten, took his own life. He was weeks away from his 20th birthday,' said Madylin in a statement. 'At this sensitive time, our family requests privacy and we beg of you to reach out to the ones you love.' Sibling actors: Sawyer Sweeten is pictured, left, in 2010 alongside his sister Madylin and brother Sullivan who also both starred in the show . Grieving sister: Madylin Sweeten took to Facebook yesterday evening to comment on the tragedy . Sawyer's mother Elizabeth posted a photo on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0on Wednesday saying how much she loved her three oldest children. She also shared a post on Facebook last Thursday that showed her and her oldest sons bowling with the family, and one on Easter of the extended family celebrating the holiday. Sawyer's Raymond costar Doris Roberts paid tribute to him on\u00a0Facebook, writing; 'It is with great sadness that I learned the news that Sawyer Sweeten, who played my grandson Geoffrey Barone on Everybody Loves Raymond, died at his family's home in Texas. 'He was a very sweet young man who will be dearly missed. Make sure your loved ones know how much you care about them, and please check in with them if you haven't touched base with them for a while. It's very important to keep in touch.' Patricia Heaton, his television mother, wrote; 'Sawyer Sweeten was a funny and exceptionally bright young man. He is gone from us far too soon.' Everybody Loves Raymond ran from 1996 - when the twin boys were just 16 months old - to 2005. The child actor, centre, appeared on stage with the show's cast in 2010 to accept a gong at the 8th Annual TV Land Awards . Devastated family: Sawyer, left, Sullivan and Madilyn with their other sister Maysa (second from right) Television mother:\u00a0Patricia Heaton, who played Sawyer's mother\u00a0Debra Barone on the hit show, wrote this message on Twitter . Based on the stand-up career of lead actor Ray Romano, the show, based on Long Island, was primarily about his strained relationship with his parents and his brother . The children, especially the twins, had smaller, cameo moments and in the beginning were too young to speak. The series developed a loyal following in the US, and was shown by Channel 4 in the UK. Sawyer and his brother hadn't acted since the show finished, though their sister did go on to appear in several films, including American Splendor and Eagle Eye. She continues to act and lives in Los Angeles. The three siblings last appeared together in public at the\u00a08th Annual TV Land Awards in 2010. They also have a younger sister Maysa, and four half-siblings; Emma, Guiliana, Elliette and Jaymeson. Madylin wrote on Facebook\u00a0Thursday evening; 'At this time I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to the ones you love. Let them have no doubt of what they mean to you.' In March, Sawyer' mother's husband Jerry posted a photo to\u00a0Facebook of Sawyer on a motorcycle, writing; 'Sawyer is riding around on a really kick ass 883 Iron!!! So proud that both my sons have done so well in learning how to ride!' Sawyer (left) and his brother Sullivan started working on Raymond when they were just 16-months-old . Sawyer was born in Brownwood, Texas in 1995, and also had roles in the film\u00a0Frank McKlusky, C.I. and the popular television show Even Stevens. The cast of Everybody Loves Raymond was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series seven times by the Screen Actors Guild, winning the coveted Actor in 2003. The show meanwhile won the Outstanding Comedy Series award at the Emmys in both 2003 and 2005. Overall, it earned 69 Emmy nominations during its run, winning 15, mostly for acting. Raymond starred Ray Romano and Patricia Heaton as Raymond and Debra Barone, a couple raising their three children in Long Island. The other main players were Raymond's parents Marie and Frank, played by Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle, and his older brother Robert, played by Brad Garret, who lived together across the street. Tragic: A photo taken last year shows Sawyer on a snowboarding trip with Sullivan and Madylin . Raymond\u00a0won the Outstanding Comedy Series award at the Emmys in both 2003 and 2005 . The child actor (left) is pictured with\u00a0Sullivan and\u00a0Madylin in 2004, a year before the show's final season . It was one of the most watched shows on the air during its ninth season, and the second most popular comedy behind NBC's Friends. When asked if he had a fondest memory from his time on the show in 2010, Sawyer said; 'All my memories are fond.'

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nNick Clegg tonight vowed to block the Tories imposing deep welfare cuts as the price of any future Coalition deal. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop David Cameron up in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash \u00a312billion from the benefits bill. In an interview on the BBC, Mr Clegg also suggested he would veto a new deal unless the Tories agreed new taxes on the rich. But the Deputy Prime Minister defended his record in government with Mr Cameron.\u00a0Asked if he was proud of his record in power, Mr Clegg said: 'Hell yes.' Scroll down for video . The Deputy Prime Minister said he would not allow the Lib Dems to prop up David Cameron in power if he insisted on pushing ahead with his plan to slash \u00a312billion from the benefits bill . The Lib Dem leader, meanwhile, accused the Tories of \u2018lashing out\u2019 at Labour because they knew they could not win the election. Mr Clegg's remarks come after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband last week. Mr Fallon said the Labour leader had stabbed his brother in the back to win the leadership and was now 'willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister' by giving up the Trident missile system to secure the support of the SNP. Mr Clegg\u2019s insistence that he will not go into Coalition with the Tories if they insist on such deep welfare cuts increases the possibility that the Lib Dems could strike a deal with Labour after the election. However, the Deputy Prime Minister said he would also veto a deal with Mr Miliband if Labour did not set out in more detail how they would slash the deficit. He said: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t accept \u00a312billion of welfare cuts. In exactly the same way that I could never countenance recommending to the Liberal Democrats entering into a coalition with the Labour Party that isn\u2019t serious about balancing the books rather than the specious stuff they\u2019ve come up with today. 'Equally I would not recommend to the Lib Dems that we go into coalition with the Conservatives if they insist on a plan which is a marked departure from what we\u2019ve done in this coalition. \u2018They\u2019re asking for \u00a312billion over two years. We\u2019ve made \u00a320billion over five. They want to ask the poorest to make additional sacrifices whilst not asking the richest to pay an additional penny through the tax system to balance the books.\u2019 In\u00a0an interview on the BBC tonight, Mr Clegg said the price of another Coalition would be new taxes on the rich and a scaling back of the Prime Minister\u2019s planned welfare cuts . Asked by host Evan Davis if he felt \u2018betrayed\u2019 by the Prime Minister at any stage since 2010, he pointed to the AV referendum. He said: \u2018It was shoddy it was unnecessary I didn\u2019t think they needed to win the argument by being quite so personal. I wish the referendum had been fought on its merits. \u2018What I have learnt about the Conservatives \u2013 and you can see it in this election campaign \u2013 when they think they\u2019re about to lose their grip on something that they like, usually power, they can lash out, they\u2019re doing it in this election campaign because they realise they\u2019re not going to win it.\u2019 But Mr Clegg said the Coalition had been \u2018worth\u2019 all the pain. He said: \u2018Yes, of course it has and any Liberal Democrat will tell you that\u2026 we took the decision as a democratic party. And we decided that notwithstanding the impact on our short term political popularity it was the right thing for the country. \u2018And a time when people are so cynical about politics, and so fed up with politicians isn\u2019t it a good thing that a party, a plucky brave party put country before party and I have an old fashioned belief that if you do the right thing, that there are plenty of fair minded folk out there who will recognise that\u2026was every decision a decision I would relish? 'Of course not. But is the country better now than it was when we found it on an economic precipice in 2010, you bet.'",
    "text": "Summary:\n\nNick Clegg, Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader, has stated that he would not support a coalition with the Conservative Party if they insist on implementing \u00a312 billion in welfare cuts. He also suggested that new taxes on the wealthy would be a condition for any future coalition deal. Clegg defended his record in the current coalition government but criticized the Conservatives for their aggressive campaign tactics against Labour.\n\nClegg indicated that he might consider a deal with Labour, but only if they provide more detailed plans for reducing the deficit. He emphasized that the Liberal Democrats would not support extreme measures from either major party.\n\nDespite acknowledging some difficulties in the current coalition, particularly regarding the AV referendum, Clegg maintained that joining the coalition was the right decision for the country. He expressed pride in his party's willingness to prioritize national interests over short-term political gains.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA father who walked out of a secretive Christian commune where everyone wears blue uniforms and birth control is non-existent said living in the community was like being in a scary thriller movie. Elijah Overcomer, 26, left Gloriavale, a town of about 500 on New Zealand's west coast,  with his wife, Rosanna, 29, and their children in late March 2013. Shortly following their departure, the family watched the 2004 psychological thriller The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan. Mr Overcomer said the film - where residents of a pretend 19th century town fear the 'wicked' outside world - was a 'good comparison with our community', especially in their views of the greater world. '(In the film), all the kids have grown up and been told the outside is unsafe. They even make their own scare tactics to scare people from going outside the wee village,' he said. 'It's kind of the same thing here. You're told if you leave Gloriavale you're lost, you lose your Salvation.' Life in Gloriavale: Wearing their customary blue uniforms, Elijah Overcomer, now 26, wife Rosanna, now 29 and two of the three children they left with are photographed inside the commune . Gloriavale baby: Daughter Honour is pictured decked out in her Gloriavale uniform . Young love: In Gloriavale blue, Elijah and Rosanna are pictured mucking around. Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune, is nestled on the banks of Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Living in the now: The Overcomers have lived outside Gloriavale for two years . Sharing candid photographs of his family's time in Gloriavale with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Overcomer said  he had been told there was 'a lot of sin' and 'bad things' in the greater world. 'You almost only get to know about the evil while you're there. 'That's all you know to be outside Gloriavale, is a lot of evil and that sort of thing.' But following their departure, the family were 'blown away' by the kindness and support shown to them by New Zealand churches in Christchurch and Timaru. The latter town, some 300kms south of Gloriavale, has become home to several former members of the sect recently following a virtual exodus. According to Sunday NZ program,  22 residents have left in the past two months. Among them includes the Ben Canaan family of 14, who famously walked out this March. 'When we left we received so much help and gifts from people especially churches at\u00a0Christchurch\u00a0and then at\u00a0Timaru,' Mr Overcomer told Daily Mail Australia. 'People (were) just helping us out giving us clothing, kitchen gear - heaps of stuff - and we were quite shocked with that. 'We've been blown away by how much love we've received outside of there. Even from people who aren't Christians, as well. 'There's a lot of really kind, caring people who want to help you. I mean, even in our district, you meet someone new and they just want to help. Just blown away. The family have faced two particular challenges leaving Gloriavale. The most devastating is that the couple are mostly unable to contact their large extended family inside the commune. 'Not being able to talk to them and see them is definitely the worst thing,' said Mr Overcomer, who is now managing a dairy farm and living in Timaru. 'Everyone can adapt into a different lifestyle. But you can't adapt from leaving your family.' A scene from the 2004 M. Night Shyamalan film, The Village. In the film, residents believed they were living in a 19th century village - but in reality the village had been founded in the 1970s . In an interview, Mr Overcomer compared the views residents in Gloriavale had of the outside world with those held in the psychological thriller The Village (above) l . Love in Gloriavale: Elijah is pictured here with Rosanna in scenic Gloriavale . One of the Overcomer's little boys, Seth, is pictured at Gloriavale . Love in Gloriavale: Rosanna is photographed here with three children, Seth (left), Zac and Honour . The deeply religious family were also forced to grapple with their views about Christianity. They were particularly afraid that, by walking out of Gloriavale they may have lost their 'Salvation' with God. 'I guess the biggest thing, other than leaving family, was feeling like our salvation was lost. 'For us, we felt that was the worst thing. Especially my wife really struggled with that. 'It wasn't until we got good teaching from the pastor at our church and he taught us through the Bible really well so we could be confident that Gloriavale was wrong and that we were actually free to go wherever we like... 'That really gave us a lot of security in what we've done. What we've been told wasn't true... You still have to tell yourself that.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.'' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.'Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms.The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels. Little Honour, pictured, grew up in Gloriavale and can be seen wearing her miniature blue uniform . Known by the name 'Hopeful Christian', Neville Cooper (pictured) was convicted of sex abuse and spent 11 months in prison in 1995 . Mr Overcomer was initially kicked out of the Gloriavale for five weeks around Christmas 2012 after 'asking too many questions' of the Elders, who rule the sect. Among the matters he asked about was the history of founder Neville Cooper, who was convicted and spent nearly a year imprisoned on sex abuse charges in 1995 . 'I don't know what really turned the corner with them. 'I guess the main thing is I even had the guts or whatever it was to ask them, to question it. 'It might seem strange looking in from out there. (But) growing up there you're real scared of them (the Elders), scared of getting in trouble with them. 'It was quite a courageous move to ask questions of them. Obviously I expected answers.' After five weeks of 'hell' separated from his family, Mr Overcomer 'repented' for his sins and returned home to Gloriavale. But the family soon decided to pick up and leave. In Gloriavale, women are required to wear a blue, full-length robe (pictured in a documentary above) Gloriavale families live together in large, communal hostels . One of the reasons the Overcomers decided to leave Gloriavale was to spend more time with their children, rather than them being 'raised as a part of a system' Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up. 'I worked outside Gloriavale, \"sharemilking\" on a neighbour's farm for the community. It was kind of then I thought I'd like my own house and things. 'And I'd like to look after my kids personally. There (in Gloriavale) your kids are raised by the system I guess. 'School, pre-school children go to pre-school - you don't really get a whole lot of time with them. 'With a farming lifestyle, you get to spend a bit more time with your children. You have a bigger input in their lives. Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up . Gloriavale is located on Lake Haupiri, on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island. Many families have left for Timaru, around 300kms south . He told Daily Mail Australia one of his 'biggest issues' with Gloriavale is how they separate dissenters from their families. 'That's the biggest thing I want to see stopped. I had a guy working for me for a while - he's got back in now. 'He was out for six months, away from his wife and family. He had three little children. 'It's that sort of behaviour I want to see stopped.' Mr Overcomer now manages a dairy farm with more than 700 cows. He said the family, who now have two more children, had 'definitely' adjusted to life in Timaru.\u00a0'We've been doing well.' Daily Mail Australia approached Gloriavale for comment but did not receive a response. The 'Ben Canaan' family of fourteen, pictured, left Gloriavale for Timaru in March 2015. Daily Mail Australia understands they have settled in well .",
    "text": "Elijah Overcomer, a former member of Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune in New Zealand, described life there as akin to a thriller movie, drawing parallels with the film \"The Village\" where residents fear the outside world. He left with his wife and children in 2013, seeking a life outside the strict confines where birth control is banned and everyone wears blue uniforms. The community, founded by Neville Cooper (later known as Hopeful Christian), is isolated and operates under strict religious control, with large families encouraged and limited contact with the outside world. Upon leaving, Overcomer and his family were surprised by the kindness and support they received from churches and communities in New Zealand. They faced challenges, particularly being cut off from their extended family within Gloriavale, and grappling with fears of losing their salvation. Overcomer criticized the community's separation of dissenters from their families and expressed a desire for change. Now settled in Timaru and managing a dairy farm, the Overcomer family has adjusted to their new life, appreciating the freedom and support they've found outside Gloriavale.",

A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly \u00a31million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just \u00a33,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her \u00a31million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent \u00a31,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made \u00a3940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud . Abdulhamid was jailed for six years after admitting three counts of conspiracy to defraud, but this year he was ordered to repay just \u00a3686 out of the \u00a374,000 profit he made from the scam. During a raid of Oshodi's home, detectives discovered computers with details of more than 11,000 credit cards, including those of almost 8,500 UK customers. In a victim impact statement, Ms Budow said she was 'physically shaking' when she was informed by the bank, adding: 'Since the theft I have been reimbursed the full amount by Santander. 'But the effect it has had on me personally has been one of complete violation of my privacy. People have gained access to my personal details and I fear what they will use the information for.' Jabeth and five others were also jailed for being involved in the scam.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nRangers boss Stuart McCall has revealed he was warned about taking over at Ibrox by Walter Smith - but insists he has made the right decision. The former Light Blues midfielder steered his new side to their third victory on the bounce with Sunday's 2-1 win over Hearts. It was a crucial triumph that moves Gers back into second place in the Scottish Championship and looks to have restored vital momentum ahead of the end-of-season play-offs. Stuart McCall says he was warned not to take the Rangers job but is pleased that he took the risk in the end . McCall has managed to unite a forlorn band of players since taking over a month ago and quickly transformed them into real promotion contenders. But he has revealed nine-in-a-row boss Smith - who McCall says was the 'greatest manager' he ever worked for - called to make sure the former Scotland international knew what he was letting himself in for when he agreed to replace Kenny McDowall. McCall, who still does not know if he will remain in charge beyond the summer, told TalkSport: 'Walter Smith rung me up on the day I took the job and asked if I knew what I'd let myself in for. 'But in fairness, he understood I would never have got the opportunity to manage such a wonderful club like this [were it not for the club's current circumstances]. The Gers boss has seen his new side win their last three games in a row including a crucial win over Hearts . 'Even though I knew it was a gamble and the pitfalls, just to be part of it has been great. 'Regardless of what happens at the end of the season, I have relished every minute of it and I'm thoroughly enjoying it, especially with the results being good.' Rangers' promotion hopes looked to have crumbled earlier this season as previous bosses Ally McCoist and McDowall struggled to maintain the required levels of morale and confidence amid the din generated by the club's bitter off-field civil war. Dave King's boardroom coup saw McCall brought in to rally the troops and his impact has been impressive. Kenny Miller (centre) fires home the opening goal for Rangers during Sunday's Scottish Championship game . Newly-crowned Scottish Championship winners Hearts were clapped on to the pitch by the home players at Ibrox. But it was Rangers who left the field to cheers after clinging onto victory after playing the entire second half a man down following skipper Lee McCulloch's red card just before the break. Kenny Miller and Haris Vuckic netted a pair of clinical strikes and McCall believes the quality of his side's goals only proves that the feel-good factor has returned to Glasgow's south side. He told the Rangers website: 'They were brilliant and the first was a good move down the left. On-loan Haris Vuckic (centre) curls home his sides second goal at Ibrox to put them in command . 'I think everyone knows Lee Wallace's capabilities when he gets forwards. Nicky Law has played him in with a good weighted pass and it was a great cutback and a fantastic finish by Kenny. He is just playing off Nicky Clark at the moment and doing it really well. 'The second goal is why Haris played today. He's got a goal in him, he's a threat. He can come in on his left foot and do what he did so it didn't surprise me when he picked it up there that it ended up in the back of the net. 'I felt for him at half-time. I explained to him that we had to bring him off and it was nothing to do with his performance, it was just because of the change of shape. 'He took it well, he understands, but what is good in the dressing room is that it's not just the 11 or the 14. There's about 22 lads and staff and everybody in there was congratulating each other for that performance. It's good to keep the momentum, the belief and the confidence high.' The Slovenian celebrates his goal as he continues to impress during his spell from Newcastle United . Rangers take on Queen of the South at Palmerston on Thursday night and McCall is expecting another battle after Gers lost 2-0 under McCoist's charge the last time they visited in December. He said: 'I saw Queen of the South against Hibs and they are well organised and we know what happened the last time we were down there. 'It was a tough night so they'll be confident as well after their victory. But the momentum carries on and we are going to have to be at our best on Thursday.'",
    "text": "Rangers manager Stuart McCall was warned by Walter Smith about the challenges of the job but is happy with his decision after securing three consecutive wins, including a crucial victory over Hearts. McCall has united the team and restored their promotion chances despite initial struggles under previous managers. He has enjoyed his time at the club and believes the quality of their goals shows the return of a positive atmosphere. Rangers face Queen of the South next, and McCall expects a tough match but hopes to maintain their momentum.",

An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. The craft was supposed to be capturing footage of the Royal Burgers Zoo chimp enclosure for a TV show. Watch the video here . Look out! An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. Following the attack, the drone crashes to the ground - only for the chimp to pounce on it . 'On the morning of Friday, April 10, 2015, the chimpanzees of Royal Burgers' Zoo once again proved how intelligent they are,' a spokesman for the zoo said. The incident happened during filming for a reality show set in the zoo. Programme makers had hoped to use the drone to capture the enclosure from above. 'Today, for the second season of the national television program Burgers' Zoo Natuurlijk, film takes were planned with a drone, with which spectacular images of the animals and their habitats could be made from above.' The drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure. 'Once the drone arrived at the chimpanzee quarters the intelligent primates immediately discovered the spying little plane and right away armed themselves with long sticks against this inquisitive electronic intruder,' the zaoo revealed. One of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch. 'Apparently very calm and satisfied, half asleep in the morning sun, the primate let the drone make its curious images. 'Until..... the drone got just a bit too close. Once grounded, the chimp investigates its prey, taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off. 'Like a flash the chimpanzee struck out with the long stick she had held hidden behind her body. With a direct hit the animal knocked the drone to the ground, where the group of primates quickly overpowered the 'prey'. 'With much enjoyment they very efficiently dismantled the play thing. 'During the entire moment of action the camera kept rolling, so despite the completely destroyed drone this still provided some very special images!' The zoo did not confirm if it was able to salvage the drone.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nThe head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday. Leonhart is a career drug agent who has led the agency since 2007 and is the second woman to hold the job. She has faced mounting pressure from Congress, where some questioned her competence in the wake of a scathing government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes. DEA head Michele Leonhart, is expected to resign soon, an Obama administration official said Tuesday, as she faces mounting criticism from Congress that she's been unable to change the agency's culture . Leonhart was widely criticized for her response to the report and a group of lawmakers said in a statement that she was 'woefully unable to change' the agency's culture. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not yet been made. Lawmakers have been pushing for Leonhart's ouster since her disastrous appearance before the House Oversight Committee last week. A majority of the committee said they had lost confidence in her and said she 'lacks the authority and will to make the tough decisions required to hold those accountable who compromise national security and bring disgrace to their positions.' The Justice Department report that jeopardized Leonhart's job recounted allegations that drug agents attended sex parties with prostitutes, some funded by local drug cartels, in a foreign country. The DEA said the incidents happened in Colombia. Several Congressional members have criticized Leonhart's competence in the wake of a government watchdog report detailing allegations that agents attended sex parties with prostitutes . The no-confidence statement was signed by 13 House Democrats and nine Republicans, including Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and the committee's top Democrat. Chaffetz went a step further, calling for Leonhart to resign or be fired. Last week, the White House voiced concerns about the Justice Department report. In a daily press briefing Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on reports that Leonhart was set to leave the agency and instead reiterated that the Obama administration had 'concerns about the material that was presented in the (inspector general) report that raised legitimate and serious questions about the conduct of some DEA officers. 'The president, as you know, maintains a very high standard for anybody who serves in his administration, particularly when it comes to law enforcement officials. And the I.G. report raised serious concerns about that conduct,' Earnest said. Leonhart has previously been the target of online petitions calling for her ouster after she distanced herself from the administration's stance on legalized marijuana, seen as a hands-off approach that lets states legalize marijuana so long as it is state regulated. In an email sent to employees last Friday, Leonhart lamented agent's 'disgraceful conduct' Marijuana remains illegal under federal law and is classified by the DEA as a Schedule 1 drug, along with drugs such as heroin and peyote. Leonhart also declined to fully endorse sentencing reform efforts supported by the Justice Department. CNN reports that Leonart sent an email to employees last Friday lamenting the recent scandals. 'This has been a very difficult week for DEA, with members of Congress and the media asking tough questions and sharing our outrage about the disgraceful conduct of a few individuals several years ago.' she wrote. 'This employee misconduct has upset me for many reasons, but especially because it calls into question the incredible reputation DEA has built over more than 40 years.' She ended the email thanking employees 'for your continued expressions of trust and confidence as we navigate through these rough waters. I know you will remain focused on our mission and the commitment to excellence that is the hallmark of who we are, and what we will always be at DEA.'",

Critics, including House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, called for her resignation or firing. While the White House expressed concern over the report's findings, Leonhart faced additional criticism for her stance against marijuana legalization and sentencing reform, both of which diverge from the Obama administration's position.

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nWashington (CNN)Judge Jeffrey Sutton doesn't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days. Sutton, who sits on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage. His opinion, issued in November, goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans. The split helped pave the way for the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case on Tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry. And it provides important insight into the legal arguments that could be made before the court by states seeking to uphold bans at a time when the national sentiment is quickly shifting in favor of same-sex marriage. \"It's an ideal piece of judicial craftsmanship,\" said Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, who believes that state bans on same-sex marriage are constitutional. Sutton \"more or less takes each and every argument that the other side has made, and then one by one by one, he explains why it doesn't work.\" Critics call the opinion an outlier and don't believe it will carry much weight, considering the number of courts that have overturned same-sex marriage bans in the nearly two years since the Supreme Court struck down the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. \"Judge Sutton's opinion stands alone,\" said Jon W. Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, a gay rights advocacy group. Sutton, 54, is the former state solicitor for Ohio, where he handled appeals for the state's attorney general. He clerked for Justices Antonin Scalia and Lewis Powell -- Scalia once called Sutton \"one of the very best law clerks I ever had.\" Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Sutton is considered a conservative jurist with a keen interest in states' rights. Here are the central arguments from his opinion that states seeking to uphold their same-sex marriage bans are expected to echo on Tuesday. It is \"dangerous and demeaning,\" Sutton wrote, to the citizenry to assume that only judges \"can fairly understand\" the arguments for and against same-sex marriage. \"Isn't the goal to create a culture in which a majority of citizens dignify and respect the rights of minority groups?\" he asked in the opinion joined by Judge Deborah L. Cook, also a Bush appointee. Critics such as Davidson have roundly condemned such reasoning. \"The people don't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards,\" Davidson said. \"They don't get to vote to violate the Constitution.\" Sutton pointed  to the drafters and their views of the 14th Amendment. \"Nobody in this case,\" he wrote, \"argues that the people who adopted the Fourteenth Amendment understood it to require the States to change the definition of marriage.\" It's an argument made to enforce the idea that there is no fundamental right to marriage for same-sex couples in the Constitution. \"From the founding of the Republic to 2003, every state defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman,\" he wrote, noting that the \"Fourteenth Amendment permits, though does not require, States to define marriage that way.\" He said that the same-sex marriage bans rationally advance a legitimate government policy. \"By creating a status (marriage) and by subsidizing it (e.g. with tax-filing privileges and deductions), the States created an incentive for two people who procreate together to stay together for purposes of rearing offspring.\" He said that states should not be accused of \"irrationality,\" but only the awareness that same-sex couples don't have children in the same way as couples of the opposite sex. Sutton pushes back on any suggestion that those who oppose same-sex marriage have negative feelings about gay and lesbian couples. He said that ballot initiatives banning same sex-marriage were not driven by hostility but were passed by \"real people who teach our children, create our jobs, and defend our shores.\" Gene Schaerr, a Washington appellate lawyer who help to defend Utah's ban on same-sex marriage, calls Sutton's opinion a road map for whoever might write an opinion supporting state bans. \"He's very much willing both in the result and in his analysis to leave the issue to the people without suggesting an answer one way or another,\" Schaerr said. But attached to Sutton's opinion was a harsh dissent from a third member of the three-judge panel that heard the case in the 6th Circuit. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, a Bill Clinton appointee, dismissed the opinion as an \"engrossing TED talk\" and a \"largely irrelevant discourse on democracy and federalism.\" Daughtrey said that Sutton failed to see the plaintiffs as individuals \"suffering actual harm.\" \"These plaintiffs are not political zealots trying to push reform on their fellow citizens, \" she wrote, but committed same-sex couples seeking equal status. Her harshest language was for Sutton's premise that the decision should be left to the democratic process. \"If we in the judiciary do not have the authority, and indeed the responsibility, to right fundamental wrongs left excused by a majority of the electorate, our whole intricate, constitutional system of checks and balances, as well as the oaths to which we swore, prove to be nothing but shams.\"",
    "text": "Summary:\n\nJudge Jeffrey Sutton of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals wrote the only recent appellate court decision upholding state bans on same-sex marriage, contrasting with numerous rulings striking down such bans. This split led to the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the case to potentially decide on a constitutional right to same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nSutton's opinion, praised by conservatives and criticized by gay rights advocates, focuses on several key arguments:\n\n1. The democratic process should decide the issue, not just judges.\n2. The 14th Amendment doesn't require states to change the definition of marriage.\n3. Traditional marriage rationally advances legitimate government policy.\n4. Opposition to same-sex marriage isn't necessarily driven by hostility.\n\nThe dissenting opinion by Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey criticized Sutton's reasoning, arguing that the judiciary has a responsibility to address fundamental wrongs, even when supported by a majority of voters.\n\nThis case provides insight into the legal arguments states may use to defend same-sex marriage bans before the Supreme Court.",

According to eyewitnesses at Benihana's Japanese Restaurant in Encino, California, Tori, hubby Dean McDermott, their kids, Liam, Stella, Hattie and Finn, and a few other guests, had enjoyed their Easter brunch, when Tori tripped and fell onto a hot Japanese style grill used to prepare food in front of customers. Tori had been laughing and having fun with her family at Easter brunch,' says a source, 'when she got up to leave and tripped, falling backwards on to a scorching hot grill. She shouted out in pain from a large burn on the back of her right arm. Scroll down for video . White hot: Tori Spelling was a trouper and stuck through her family brunch at Benihana restaurant in LA. But once outside she was seen inspecting the bad burn on her right arm . Tori's doctor's determined she had a severe burn and suggested they remove the damaged skin and graft skin from another area of the body, a source tells Daily Mail Online. 'She questioned if it was absolutely necessary but doctors said she risked severe infection and scarring if she didn't act right away' Tori was eventually taken to the Grossman Burn Center at the West Hills Hospital for treatment. It was determined that she needed skin grafts . 'You could tell she was hurting, but she was trying to put on a brave face for the sake of her four young children who were quite obviously worried,' says the source. 'Dean looked upset too, but you could tell they were doing their best to stay calm and not alarm the children.' Tori posted this cryptic message on her Instagram following the incident: \u00a0Perfect @Easter Sunday. Aside from the Benihana Burn! According to sources, Spelling went home and tried nursing her injury herself, but by the following day she was in so much pain she went to her doctor who ordered her to immediately undergo treatment at the Grossman Burn Center in West Hills, California. 'Tori's doctor's determined she had a severe burn and suggested they remove the damaged skin and graft skin from another area of the body,' says a source. 'She questioned if it was absolutely necessary but doctors said she risked severe infection and scarring if she didn't act right away. Dean looks on concerned as Tori inspects her burned arm . Tori and family and a friend \u00a0were set to enjoy a wonderful Easter Brunch at Benihana restaurant . Tori posted this cryptic message on her Instagram following the incident . 'She underwent a skin graft last week and must now spend several days recuperating. Friends are praying for her to make a full recovery.' The Grossman Burn Center was founded by the late Dr. Richard Grossman, who treated many badly burned LA firefighters and plane crash victims over the years. He was also famous for helping comedian Richard Pryor heal after he set himself on fire while free-basing cocaine in 1980. Today Richard's son Dr. Peter Grossman heads up the facility his father began. The 41-year-old 90210 star has had a tough time these past few years. She suffered heartbreak in 2013 after discovering her husband of nine years, actor Dean McDermott cheated on her, and the painful journey to mend their marriage was documented on their reality show, True Tori. In addition, Spelling, who turns 42 next month, has been embroiled in an on-again-off-again feud with her super rich mother, Candy Spelling, that left her feeling abandoned by the Spelling family matriarch. She's also suffered extreme pain due to a neck injury, but refuses to have surgery to repair the problem. And just last week rumors began circulating that her 48-year-old husband may have cheated on her once again \u2013 this time with his 52-year-old ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace. 'Tori could certainly use a bit of good luck in her life for a change,' says the source. 'And we all hope she will pull through this latest incident the way she's managed to pull through the other set - backs in her life.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nA financial fund for killer cop Michael Slager was shut down by crowd-funding website, GoFundMe, on Wednesday. The site told Daily Mail Online that 'after review by our team, the campaign set up for Officer Slager was removed due to a violation of GoFundMe's terms & conditions' but refused to elaborate due to privacy concerns. Slager has been charged with the murder of unarmed black father Walter Scott, 50, who was fatally shot five times in the back in North Charleston, South Carolina on Saturday. Slager, 33, was terminated from the police force on Wednesday. A separate fundraising campaign was started on site, Indiegogo, titled the 'Michael T. Slager Support Fund' and featured a picture of Slager in his police uniform. As of Thursday at 11am, it had raised $393 of a $5,000 goal on donations from 20 people after being set up on Wednesday. Two hours later, that total had jumped to $541. Scroll down for video . An Indiegogo page  to raise money in support of police officer Michael Slager had $393 of a $5,000 goal on Thursday - the company told Daily Mail Online 'they don't judge' as long as content fits their terms of use . A well-wisher of the accused killer cop gave a private donation to the fundraising page on Indiegogo and listed their name as 'trayvon' - perhaps in a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012 . Officer Michael Slager is pictured standing over Walter Scott's body and feeling for a pulse after he put the man's fallen body in handcuffs. According to police reports, officers performed CPR on the 50-year-old father - but the cop was not filmed giving any medical assistance . Opening fire: Michael Slager, a police officer in Charleston, South Carolina, was caught on video shooting dead 50-year-old black man Walter Scott after reportedly stopping him over a broken tail light on Saturday . One of the individuals who donated listed their name as 'Trayvon' - perhaps a twisted reference to Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida in 2012. An explanation of the fundraising campaign reads: 'We're campaigning to show our Support for Officer Michael T. Slager! 'We believe in all of our LEOs and want to publicly support them! Although he may have made mis-steps in judgement he was protecting the community. 'Michael is a former Coast Guardsman with two stepchildren and a wife who is expecting a child, served for more than five years with the department without being disciplined. Please help in any way you can.' Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was a U.S. Coast Guard veteran. Police officer Michael Sagler, (pictured right in his prison mugshot), who has been charged with his murder also was a member of the Coast Guard . A Facebook page was set up to support the cop who has been charged with murder and terminated from the police force . The statement then repeated: 'He has served five years with the department without being disciplined.' A separate Facebook page and Twitter account were set up linking to the fundraising site. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person, who tweeted: 'We're not here to judge wrong or right, there are two sides to every story. Let the courts decide after careful review.' The social media pages attracted dozens of negative comments. Marquese Lewis posted on the Facebook page supporting Slager: 'How about the real reason is you are an ignorant racist supporting a murderer.' Bruce A McIntyre added: 'If he cannot afford a lawyer, the court will appoint a Public Defender for him. Surely he is fine with that, as that is all most of his arrestees ever get.' In a statement to Daily Mail Online, an Indiegogo spokesperson said: 'Indiegogo allows anyone, anywhere to fund ideas that matter to them and just like other open platforms -- such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - we don\u2019t judge the content of campaigns as long as they are in compliance with our Terms of Use.' Indiegogo's list 'Prohibited Campaigns' includes those 'to raise funds for illegal activities, to cause harm to people or property, or to scam others'. The rules state: 'Campaign Owners shall not make any false or misleading statements in connection with their Campaigns.' The crowd-funding 'community guidelines go further and explain the website is not a place for 'hatred, abuse, discrimination, disrespect, profanity, meanness, harassment, or spam'. It reads on: 'Do not use to promote violence, degradation, subjugation, discrimination or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity.' A Twitter account also supported Michael Slager after he fatally shot a father-of-four. The social media accounts appear to have been established by the same person . On Wednesday, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey said that Slager's wife, who is eight months' pregnant, will still receive health insurance from the city until after her baby was born because it was the 'humane thing to do'. Last year, GoFundMe came under fire after allowing fundraising for Darren Wilson, a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown. In five days, people gave half a million-dollars to two fundraising pages for Wilson. The page has since been removed. Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force but was not charged with any crime after a grand jury hearing.",
    "text": "After a video surfaced of South Carolina police officer Michael Slager fatally shooting unarmed Walter Scott in the back, crowdfunding efforts to support Slager were met with mixed reactions. While GoFundMe shut down a campaign due to terms of service violations, a separate campaign on Indiegogo raised over $500. The Indiegogo campaign, which emphasized Slager's clean record and family situation, drew criticism and comparisons to the Trayvon Martin case, with one donation sarcastically listed as \"trayvon.\" Critics questioned the ethics of supporting a police officer charged with murder, while supporters emphasized due process and the need to support law enforcement. The incident sparked debate about race, police brutality, and the role of crowdfunding in controversial cases.",

The 32-year-old was inspecting a weapons factory in the country's capital of Pyongyang in a visit filmed by North Korean Central TV. The footage shows the mysterious dictator waving and smiling to the crowds, with his right-hand wrist wrapped up in a white bandage. Scroll down for video . Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages . It is the latest in a string of presumed health problems for the North Korean dictator, aged 32 . According to a South Korean official, quoted in Sky News, Jong-Un must have suffered the injury in the recent past. 'He didn't have the injury when he inspected a military unit on April 4,' the government spokesman said, 'so it must be recent.' Doctors who have examined the photos say it is unlikely that he has fractured his wrist, and judged it to be a minor injury. The state of Kim Jong-Un's health is the subject of fascination around the globe, as he presides over the world's most secretive state. Kim Jong-un resurfaced after six weeks of no appearances in October, walking with the help of a walking stick. There were rumours that he had had a gastric band fitted, or suffering from gout which put pressure on his feet . Pictured here with army generals in 2012, King Jong-Un is named the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He has previously revealed plans to launch nuclear strikes on US cities . In autumn 2014 he vanished for six weeks after he was spotted limping across a stage - sparking speculation that an attempted coup in the country or health problems including a leg injury, gout or a gastric band operation were behind the disappearance.. During that time state media reported he was suffering from an unnamed 'uncomfortable physical condition'. He re-appeared in October, walking with the help of a black cane.",

Jodie Bredo, 26, from Essex, has been a Kate lookalike for six years and wishes the Duchess of Cambridge would 'change her hair for once' - suggesting she opt for a bob style. Jodie, who is now single after splitting from her boyfriend, said of the Duchess, who is expecting her second child: 'Kate\u2019s just too frumpy for her age. Scroll down for video . She often does jobs with a Prince William lookalike (left) but says she fancies the younger Prince Harry more . Jodie Bredo, 26, (pictured) has been a professional Kate Middleton lookalike for the past six years . 'I know I'm seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun. I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off. I\u2019d love her to get something more fashionable like a bob.' Miss Bredo admits she does not fancy Prince William and is not tempted to have her own happy ending like the royal couple. She said: 'I do lots of jobs with a William lookalike, but I don\u2019t see him like that. Prince Harry's the better one. His bad boy image is more for me.' Although her counterpart is in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London currently awaiting her second child, Miss Bredo is not keen to start a family herself. The glamorous Essex resident said: 'I've recently broken up with a long-term boyfriend so I\u2019m not thinking about babies. 'Kate\u2019s new baby isn\u2019t making me broody,' said the lookalike (with her nephew Louis). 'I've got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it\u2019s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end' 'I know I\u2019m seven years younger than her but she should dress more fun,' said Miss Bredo (left). 'I like wearing fitted dresses and showing my figure off' 'Kate\u2019s new baby isn\u2019t making me broody. I\u2019ve got two nephews and one's the same age as Prince George - but it\u2019s nice to hand them back to their mum at the end.' Miss Bredo started her career after noticing her resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge. She was routinely stopped in the street when Kate first came into the public eye while dating Prince William. She said: 'I was shopping in Debenhams with my mum when this woman came running after us. 'I thought I\u2019d left something, but she just said, \"I have to tell you, you look so much after Kate Middleton.\" 'Even at the opticians having my eyes tested, the optometrist told me I looked like her. Miss Bredo (left, with her mum and sister) began her career after people kept commenting on her likeness to Kate Middleton . She sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009 and was hired for a shoot in Tatler . 'My family were on holiday in Cyprus and Kate was in the newspaper. My mum told me I looked like her and needed to do something with it.' Miss Bredo sent an email to a lookalike agency with her photographs in 2009. She said: 'I was accepted but didn\u2019t hear from them about any jobs. I wasn\u2019t too bothered. I was working as a personal assistant at the time and didn\u2019t think about it. 'In March 2009, I had a call from them saying I had my first job. When they said it was for Tatler magazine, I couldn\u2019t believe it. 'I took the day off and had to go to Aintree races, the shoot was based around what they thought Kate should be wearing. I was in these mad outfits. 'This one dress had plastic panelling all down the arms so I couldn't even move my arm to have a drink.' After the royal couple\u2019s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo (third from left) began working as a lookalike full-time . After the royal couple\u2019s engagement in October 2010, Miss Bredo began working as a lookalike full-time. She said: 'I had so many calls I was doing four to five days a week, appearing at corporate events and doing shoots. 'It was really strange, people wanting a picture with me, but I got into it and really had fun.' Miss Bredo studies Kate\u2019s mannerisms as well as following her beauty regime. She said: 'I have regular trims to keep my hair looking good, every two months and curl the ends the same as Kate. 'Her signature look is a lot of black eyeliner so I get through that really quickly. 'I spend \u00a330 a month buying black eyeliner. My favourite brand is Bare Minerals. She has regular trims to keep her hair in good shape, spends \u00a330 a month on black eyeliner, has regular manicures and buys clothes that are distinctly 'Kate' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George last year, Miss Bredo (middle) has had plenty of shoots with tots and has even has to wear a baby bump . 'She also wears very harsh blusher and has natural nails so I give myself regular manicures.' Miss Bredo spends hours searching for the Duchess on the internet so she can keep up-to-date with her wardrobe. She said: 'If she\u2019s wearing something new, I\u2019ll try and find it but it\u2019s usually sold out instantly. 'I know what kind of clothes she\u2019ll wear now. 'When I\u2019m going clothes shopping I\u2019ll choose some things that I think are \"Kate.\" 'I picked up this black and white spotted dress and my mum didn't think it was something the Duchess of Cambridge would wear. 'Then I saw a picture of her when she was pregnant with George \u2013 it was the same one I\u2019d bought. 'I think she\u2019s copying me now.' Kate Middleton (pictured in London on 12 March) is due to give birth to her second child with Prince William any day now . Miss Bredo usually appears with a William lookalike and their after-work drinks get plenty of attention. She said: 'You can tell people are staring and some people take sneaky pictures of us. 'But a lot of people come up and ask to take a picture, it\u2019s funny we\u2019re just two friends having a drink. 'Even on my own I get lots of double takes \u2013 especially if I\u2019m in London.' Since the duchess gave birth to Prince George, aged one, Miss Bredo has had plenty of shoots with tots. She said: 'I\u2019ve got used to holding babies now and when I do events they provide me with a bump. 'I\u2019m looking to forward to losing that now she\u2019s having the baby.'",

A bad-tempered managing director repeatedly punched his wife in the face after he shouted at her for not doing the ironing. David Bulman, 55, and his wife Lubova had a row after he criticised her for not doing the chores or checking to see if his shirt buttons were missing. His wife threw all his shirts outside, but he followed her and shouted at her before he pulled her hair and punched her several times in the face. Neighbours called the police after Bulman drove away, damaging a gate post and a van, leaving his frightened wife with a black eye and a lump on her head. Bulman was given a 12-month community order after he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court. Recorder Jim Tindal also ordered Bulman to complete rehabilitation and programme requirements, and not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife. He said: 'As a result of an argument in which things were said on both sides you lost your temper, you lost control and you behaved appallingly. 'You punched your partner several times and got into your car. 'You hit a wall and your blood was up. You were not thinking straight and as a result your partner sustained unpleasant injuries.' He added: 'We sometimes say behaviour is out of character. 'Sometimes the public is a little bit sceptical about that, but in your case it is true. 'You have had almost 40 years of keeping out of trouble in which you have been running a business, employing people and participating in society in a number of ways.'

He was also ordered not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife . Julian Howells, prosecuting, said the 'defendant was doing less' and the relationship deteriorated, with the pair arguing and her mentioning his 'personal habits'. They argued about the ironing and he attacked her, before leaving in his car from their home in Clevedon. Sam Jones, defending, said Bulman had not been in trouble with the law for 30 years and had suffered a stroke a number of years ago. He added: 'These proceedings have had a punitive element for him. He shows deep remorse and very real upset at the breakdown of the relationship with his wife. 'Mr Bulman is a successful businessman, the managing director of a company in Bristol. 'It has a significant turnover. He is a director and they employ 15 people.' Bulman was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation, \u00a3260 court costs and a \u00a360 victim surcharge and as he left court the recorder told him: 'The onus is on you to keep your temper.'",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nThe pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories . Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty . Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 \u2013 the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations and seven times higher than France\u2019s 0.4 per cent. According to an International Monetary Fund report, this was enough for Britain to leapfrog socialist France and become the second most powerful economy in Europe, behind Germany. The UK is expected to cement its position in the coming years as one of the fastest growing major economies in the West. The IMF is forecasting \u2018solid\u2019 growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 2.3 per cent in 2016. Scroll down for video . The UK clocked up growth of 2.8 per cent in 2014 \u2013 the strongest in the Group of Seven industrialised nations . Despite a slight downgrade for 2016 \u2013 the IMF\u2019s initial forecast was 2.4 per cent \u2013 this is still enough for Britain to leave other EU nations trailing in its wake. Output in France is forecast to expand by 1.2 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent next year, while Germany is set to grow by 1.6 per cent then 1.7 per cent. Within the G7, only the US is expected to perform better than Britain. \u2018In the United Kingdom, lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions are expected to support continued steady growth,\u2019 the IMF said. The World Economic Outlook report, which was published yesterday, will be seen as a boost for the Conservatives ahead of next month\u2019s General Election. The Fund also appeared to back Tory plans to return Britain to the black after years of borrowing and rising debt. It will come as another blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who has pledged to bring traditionally Left-wing policies back to Britain \u2013 mirroring the actions of Francois Hollande in France. The French president swept to power in 2012 promising to take on the rich and big business, but the country\u2019s economy has been in a rut ever since. Unemployment in France is 10.6 per cent compared to 5.7 per cent in Britain. George Osborne, left, said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government, as IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard, right, warned that debt levels are 'very high' in many European countries . George Osborne used last month\u2019s Budget to boast that Yorkshire has created more jobs than the whole of France. The Chancellor yesterday said the recovery would be put at serious risk by a Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party. \u2018These IMF growth forecasts for the UK are further proof our economic plan is working,\u2019 he said. \u2018So we must finish the job.\u2019 IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard warned that debt levels are \u2018very high\u2019 in many European countries and said \u2018it would be desirable to decrease them\u2019.",
    "text": "Britain has surpassed France to become the second largest economy in Europe, according to recent figures. In 2014, the UK achieved a growth rate of 2.8%, the highest among the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized nations, and significantly outpacing France's 0.4% growth. This growth enabled Britain to overtake France as Europe's second most powerful economy, following Germany. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts continued strong growth for the UK, with forecasts of 2.7% in 2015 and 2.3% in 2016. These projections suggest that the UK will maintain its economic lead over other EU nations, including France and Germany. The IMF attributes Britain's growth to lower oil prices and improved financial market conditions. The World Economic Outlook report is seen as a boost for the Conservative Party in the lead-up to the General Election, supporting their economic policies. In contrast, the French economy remains sluggish, with high unemployment and lower growth forecasts. UK Chancellor George Osborne emphasized that the recovery could be jeopardized by a Labour government. IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard highlighted high debt levels in Europe, suggesting a need for reduction.",

    "prompt": "Summarize the following text:\n\nKim Kardashian has revealed that she is going to great lengths to make sure that her luxurious designer wardrobe stays in mint condition because she plans on handing \u2018everything\u2019 down to her 22-month-old daughter North West. The 34-year-old reality star explained that she is creating an 'archive' of her most infamous outfits, which she stores in clear plastic bags, because she is keen on the idea of North inheriting her wardrobe when she gets older. '[\u2018I\u2019m saving] every last piece,\u2019 Kim told The Huffington Post\u00a0of her most memorable designer ensembles. \u2018Everything. I have a full archive. The dress that I wore on the cover of Vogue will be hers. All of my Met Gala dresses.' Scroll down for video . Family values: Kim, who is pictured with her smiling daughter North West, revealed that the 22-month-old will inherit her entire wardrobe when she gets older . Mini-me: Kim Kardashian and her 22-month-old daughter North West wear matching back while sightseeing in\u00a0Armenia . The mother-of-one added: 'I keep everything and put it in these clear plastic bags altogether with the shoes - the whole look of what I wore.' As Kim named her Givenchy wedding dress, which she wore last May to wed Kanye West in Florence, Italy, as the 'prize piece' in her clothing collection, it\u2019s likely that the one-of-a-kind gown will also be handed down to her young daughter one day. Kim credited her husband for 'introducing' her to the fashion world and added that she wants their daughter to follow in their footsteps and be confident in what she wears. She added: 'I took a lot of direction from my husband when he introduced me more to the fashion world. And now I love taking risks. I love wearing things that maybe I couldn\u2019t quite understand at the time.' And Kim maintained that she loves all forms of personal style as long as it's unique to the individual. 'I just love when someone has their own style - even if it\u2019s something that I wouldn\u2019t wear,' she said. 'So I would just encourage North to be herself and wear what she thinks she looks good in. Just be yourself and take risks.' Hot mommy: The 34-year-old, pictured in a figure-hugging nude skirt, said she thinks she dresses sexier now that is a mother . Kim also admitted that she is usually responsible for dressing North, she said the 37-year-old rapper always finds something 'super cute' for their little girl to wear. 'I love when he picks out her clothes,' she explained. 'I know if I go downstairs to make breakfast and ask him to get her dressed that she\u2019ll come down looking super cute. But usually I pretty much pick out her outfits.' And with a mother as glamorous and as make-up savvy as Kim, it's no surprise that North is already developing an obsession with beauty products - and shoes. Last week, The Keeping Up with the Kardashian star spoke with\u00a0Elle.com\u00a0about her daughter's budding independence and style preferences while sharing her approach to being a businesswoman, mother, wife and dressing\u00a0her post-baby body. '[North] is obsessed with make-up and watching me get ready and getting ready herself,' Kim told the website. 'She just loves the process. She could not be more ultimately girly-girl.' Family time: Kim can be seen holding North's hand while she and Kanye tour Armenia . Stellar style: North wore a black fringed dress, black combat boots and an olive green jacket while out with her parents . The mother-of-one noted that after she gives North, who will turn two in June, a bath her adorable daughter always asks for her 'purse' because she really wants to grab her mom's make-up bag, which is inside. Kim said that if she turns around for a second, North will have her lipstick 'all over her face', so she had to give her a 'little make-up bag' of her own. Not surprisingly, the reality TV star, who often matches North's outfits to her own, admitted that she likes it when kid's wear 'mini-me styles' and she loves 'seeing kids in black'. While Kim insisted that North 'gravitates towards really simple things' when it comes to clothing, she noted that her little girl 'loves accessories'. According to Kim, the toddler always requests a pair of shoes to wear first thing in the morning. She added that North 'just discovered backpacks so she loves to put them on'. In fact, North loves luggage in general. The precious tot, who has been photographed lugging a small Frozen-themed suitcase through the airport, always tries to take her mom's luggage. Holiday spirit: North donned a flower and a white ensemble that matched her mother's dress when the Kardashian family went to church on Easter . Matching looks: Kim and North donned neutral coats during a trip to the airport . 'We got the Frozen suitcase so she has to carry it everywhere,' she explained. 'It took us about 30 minutes longer to get through the airport because she had to carry her suitcase herself.\u2019 She noted that North didn't want to be picked up, adding: 'She's very independent . Kim believes that her daughter's independence may have to do with the fact she was adamant about North sleeping in her own room - and now that's where she prefers to be. 'She kind of likes to be in her own room and that has allowed [Kanye and I] to have our time together,' she said. Kim said that she doesn't want to tell anyone how to parent, but it was important to her as a new mom that she set boundaries and dedicate five to ten percent of her day to herself in order to maintain her sanity. In sync: North, who loves accessories, was photographed wearing a YSL bag to the airport and striped pants that matched her mom's button-down shirt . 'It worked for me to be able to get my work out in, make me feel good about myself, put my daughter down to bed at a decent time, and have the night with my husband,' she said. And because those post-baby workouts helped her get back in shape, she has a newfound confidence that has inspired her to flaunt her body in cleavage-baring tops and figure-hugging dresses. '[I think I dress] sexier now than I did before,' she said of her mommy style. Kim, who helped her sisters Kourtney and Khloe launch their latest Kardashian Kids children's collection at Nordstrom.com on Monday, noted that she always gives 100per cent of herself to every project she takes on. 'Nothing comes easy,' she said. 'I know that people joke all the time and try to figure out, you know, what it is that I do, but I work really hard. I get up every day at 5 a.m. and start my day.'",
